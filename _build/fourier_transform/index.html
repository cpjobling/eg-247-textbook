<h1 id="Fourier-Transform">Fourier Transform<a class="anchor-link" href="#Fourier-Transform"> </a></h1><p>This chapter continues our coverage of <strong>Fourier Analysis</strong> with an introduction to the <strong>Fourier Transform</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fourier Series</strong> is used when we are dealing with signals that are <em>periodic</em> in time. It is based on harmonics of the fundamental frequency $\Omega_0$ of the periodic signal where the period $T = 2\pi/\Omega_0$.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The line spectrum occur at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency $k\omega_0$ and is a <em>discrete</em> (or sampled) function of frequency.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As the period $T$ is increased, the distance between harmonics decreases because $\Omega_0$ reduces.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the limit $T\to \infty$, the signal becomes <strong>aperiodic</strong> and $k\Omega_0 \to \omega$ which is a <em>continuous</em> function of frequency.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the basis of the <strong>Fourier Transform</strong> which is very important as the basis for data transmission, signal filtering, and the determination of system frequency reponse.</p>
