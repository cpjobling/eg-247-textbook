<h2 id="Aims">Aims<a class="anchor-link" href="#Aims"> </a></h2><p>The purpose of this laboratory is to explore more of the features of the MATLAB <em>Symbolic Math Toolbox</em>, in particular the <code>laplace</code> and <code>ilaplace</code> functions. These will be used to verify some of the properties of the Laplace transform typically published in textbooks and in tables of properties and transforms and to solve some inverse transform problems.</p>

<h2 id="Peer-Assessment">Peer Assessment<a class="anchor-link" href="#Peer-Assessment"> </a></h2><p>Peer assessment is valuable for the following three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>You will be able to learn something about the electronic assessment processes being used in the University.</li>
<li>You will learn more about how to give and receive constructive feedback.</li>
<li>It encourages you to to realistic in your claims and increases my confidence in self-assessment as a valid method of marking coursework.</li>
<li>By seeing several submissions, you will be able to identify good and poor practice and be encouraged improve your own work.</li>
<li>It allows me to distribute the load of validating individual claims making grading more efficient for me.</li>
</ol>
<p>The claims on this and the next lab submission will be moderated by <strong>Peer Assessment</strong>. Each one of you will be asked to review two of this second submission, and one of the next.</p>
<p>For this lab exercise, the peer assessment is worth three marks. There is a total of 10 marks available for your participation in peer assessment.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-do-Peer-Assessment">How to do Peer Assessment<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-to-do-Peer-Assessment"> </a></h2><p>As a peer assessor, you will be required to review two of these submissions and let me know if you agree with the self-assigned score.</p>
<p>To complete your peer assessments, you should download and run the MATLAB Live Scripts and check that the results are correct and complete.</p>
<h3 id="Checking-the-submitted-work">Checking the submitted work<a class="anchor-link" href="#Checking-the-submitted-work"> </a></h3><p>On Monday 2nd March, you should receive notification that the submissions of two of your colleagues are available for peer assessment. This notification will arrive by email (if you have your Canvas notifications turned on) or via the inbox on Canvas or the Canvas Student App.</p>
<p>To perform an assessment, you will need access to MATLAB. If you have problems running any files that are submitted, please note this in your feedback.</p>
<p>To perform a Peer Assessment you should visit each submission, review the claim form submitted and download the attached files. I would recommend that you create a folder for each submission. I would also recommend that you clear the MATLAB workspace (see command below) before testing each submitted file.</p>
<p><code>matlab
clear all</code></p>
<h3 id="Assessment-procedure-for-this-lab">Assessment procedure for this lab<a class="anchor-link" href="#Assessment-procedure-for-this-lab"> </a></h3><ol>
<li>Open the Live Script file <code>laplace_lab.mlx</code> and execute <strong>run all</strong>. Check that the results are all present and that there are no errors. Review the formatting of the file and think about how readable and understandable the script is as a record of the experiment. </li>
<li>Repeat for <code>ilaplace_lab.mlx</code>. </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Grading">Grading<a class="anchor-link" href="#Grading"> </a></h3><p>Use the grading rubric to confirm your peer's self assessment. <strong>Note</strong> you may may award a higher mark if you feel that the student has marked themselves too harshly! You should give a reason for your score if it does not agree with the student's own self-assessment.</p>
<h3 id="Feedback">Feedback<a class="anchor-link" href="#Feedback"> </a></h3><p>You should also provide feedback on the student's approach to the lab exercise. Your comments might include comments on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any problems you encountered checking your peer's submission.</li>
<li>Use of headings and sections to break up the Live Script documentation of the lab exercises.</li>
<li>Good use of textual comments in the Live Script file to explain the MATLAB code.</li>
<li>Things that the student did that you wish you had thought of.</li>
<li>Suggestions on what the student may do next time to clarify their approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the instructor will moderate all peer assessments before assigning the final grade.</p>
