<h2 id="Lab-Exercises">Lab Exercises<a class="anchor-link" href="#Lab-Exercises"> </a></h2><p>In all these exercises you should add sections, headings and explanatory text to document your Live Script files so and help your peer assessor understand your solutions.</p>
<h3 id="Lab-Exercise-4">Lab Exercise 4<a class="anchor-link" href="#Lab-Exercise-4"> </a></h3><p>Download the linked script file <a href="solution3.m">solution3.m</a> for the Solution for Example 3 from Week 3. Open it as a Live Script file and run all the code. Study the file which presents part of the solution to Textbook Example 4.3.</p>
<p>Starting from the simplified circuit (Fig. 4.9 from <a href="https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/swansea-ebooks/reader.action?docID=3384197&amp;ppg=101#ppg=101">Karris</a>, 2012: p4-5):</p>
<p><img src="fig4_9.png" alt="Transformed circuit of Example 4.3"></p>
<p>Save the Live Script file then save it as <code>ex4.mlx</code>. Modify the script file by adding explanatory text and MATLAB commands to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Define equation 4.5 in MATLAB:</p>
<p><code>eq45 = (Vout - 1 - 3/s)/(1/s + 2 + s/2) + Vout/1 + Vout/(s/2) == 0</code></p>
<p>Now use  <code>Vout = solve(eq45,Vout)</code> function to confirm Equation 4.6</p>
<p>$$V_{\mathrm out}(s) = \frac{2s(s+3)}{s^3+8s^2+10s+4}.$$</p>
</li>
<li>Use <code>roots</code> to find the factors of the denominator $$s^3+8s^2+10s+4$$ and expand the terms with complex roots to find the quadratic factor.</li>
<li>Use the inverse Laplace Transform on the rational polynomial with real and quadratic factors to determine the symbolic expression <code>vout</code> as a function of time.</li>
<li>Verify that the response is $$v_{\mathrm out}(t) = \left(1.36e^{-6.57t}+0.64e^{-0.715t}\cos 0.316t -1.84e^{-0.715t}\sin 0.316t\right)u_0(t)$$</li>
<li>Use <code>ezplot</code> to plot this result.</li>
<li>Compare your answer with the numerical solution computed in the script.</li>
</ol>
<p>Save your solution <code>ex4.mlx</code> for upload to Canvas.</p>
<h3 id="Lab-Exercise-5:-Problem-Solving-in-MATLAB">Lab Exercise 5: Problem Solving in MATLAB<a class="anchor-link" href="#Lab-Exercise-5:-Problem-Solving-in-MATLAB"> </a></h3><p>Choose one of the Problems Q1-Q3 from Section 4.7 of Karris 2012 (page 4-21) and use MATLAB to adapt the methods used to solve the problem in <strong>Lab Exercise 4</strong> to determine the required solution.</p>
<p>Save your chosen solution as a Live Script file with the name <code>ex5.mlx</code> for upload to Canvas.</p>
<h3 id="Lab-Exercise-6:-Complex-Impedance-and-Admittance">Lab Exercise 6: Complex Impedance and Admittance<a class="anchor-link" href="#Lab-Exercise-6:-Complex-Impedance-and-Admittance"> </a></h3><p>The linked file solves Example 4.5 from Karris 2012 (Example 5 in the notes). The solution concerns the calculation of the Complex Impedance and Admittance of the Circuit shown in Figure 4.16.</p>
<p>Linked file: <a href="solution5.m">solution5.m</a>.</p>
<p><img src="4_16.png" alt="Circuit for Example 4.5"></p>
<p>Download the file into MATLAB, open it as a Live Script file and use it to verify the equation for the circuit impedance $Z(s)$ given in the notes and the text. Extend it to calculate the admittance $Y(s)$.</p>
<p>Use the same technique to solve Q4 from Section 4.7 (Exercises) of Karris (p. 4-21).</p>
<p>Save your solution to a Live Script file with the name <code>ex6.mlx</code> for upload to Canvas.</p>
<h3 id="Mini-Project-2:-Transfer-Functions">Mini Project 2: Transfer Functions<a class="anchor-link" href="#Mini-Project-2:-Transfer-Functions"> </a></h3><p>Download the linked MATLAB script which computes the solution to Example 4.7 
from Karris (2007) (Example 7 from the notes). This script computes the 
transfer function of the Op-Amp circuit shown below:</p>
<p><img src="fig4_21.png" alt="The s-Domain circuit for Example 4.7"></p>
<p>Linked script file: <a href="solution7.m">solution7.m</a>.</p>
<p>In the original example:</p>
<p>R1 = 20 kOhm</p>
<p>R2 = 40 kOhm</p>
<p>R3 = 50 kOhm</p>
<p>C1 = 25 nF</p>
<p>C2 = 10 nF</p>
<p>Use your student number to give a different set of component values whiles maintaining the relative sizes.</p>
<p>For example if your number was 876543 you might use:</p>
<p>R1 = <strong>8</strong>0 kOhm</p>
<p>R2 = <strong>7</strong>0 kOhm</p>
<p>R3 = <strong>6</strong>0 kOhm</p>
<p>C1 = <strong>54</strong> nF</p>
<p>C2 = <strong>3</strong>0 nF</p>
<p>If your student number contains 0s, you should substitute a digit if your choice.
You may find <code>doc</code> or <code>help</code> and the symbolic toolbox function <code>sym2poly</code> useful.</p>
<p>To Do: open <code>solution7.m</code> as a Live Script file and save as <code>proj2.mlx</code>. Adapt the script to repeat the computation using component values based on your student number.</p>
<p>Then add text and instructions to:</p>
<ol>
<li>compute and plot the phase response of Gs - see function <code>angle</code></li>
<li>make a transfer function LTI object <code>Gs2 = tf(numG,denG)</code></li>
<li>Compare frequency response with result of <code>bode(Gs2)</code></li>
<li>Plot the pole-zero map of <code>Gs2</code> using the <code>pzmap</code> function.</li>
<li>Plot the step response of <code>Gs2</code> using the <code>step</code> function.</li>
<li>Compute and plot the response of <code>Gs2</code> to a sinusoid using the <code>lsim</code> function.</li>
<li>Repeat the simulation of the sinsoidal response in Simulink - save model as <code>proj2.slx</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Submit the files <code>proj2.mlx</code> and <code>proj2.slx</code> to Canvas.</p>
