<h1 id="Peer-Assessment">Peer Assessment<a class="anchor-link" href="#Peer-Assessment"> </a></h1><p>Peer assessment is valuable for the following three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>You will be able to learn something about the electronic assessment processes being used in the University.</li>
<li>You will learn more about how to give and receive constructive feedback.</li>
<li>It encourages you to to realistic in your claims and increases my confidence in self-assessment as a valid method of marking coursework.</li>
<li>By seeing several submissions, you will be able to identify good and poor practice and be encouraged improve your own work.</li>
<li>It allows me to distribute the load of validating individual claims making grading more efficient for me.</li>
</ol>
<p>The claims on this and the next two lab submissions will be moderated by <strong>Peer Assessment</strong>. Each one of you will be asked to review three of this first submission, two of the second and one of the third.</p>
<p>For this lab exercise, the peer assessment is worth five marks. There is a total of 10 marks available for your participation in peer assessment.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-do-Peer-Assessment">How to do Peer Assessment<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-to-do-Peer-Assessment"> </a></h2><p>As a peer assessor, you will be required to review three of these submissions and let me know if you agree with the self-assigned score.</p>
<p>To complete your peer assessments, you should download and run the MATLAB Live Scripts and Simulink models and check that the results are correct and complete.</p>
<h3 id="Timings">Timings<a class="anchor-link" href="#Timings"> </a></h3><p>University policy requires that staff submit feedback on coursework within three weeks of the submission deadline. As I need to moderate all peer assessment marks before I can release the marks and feedback, this means that all peer assessment has to be completed within two weeks -- <em>preferably one week</em> -- of the peer assessment window opening.</p>
<p>Therefore, do please do give any outstanding peer assessments priority!</p>
<h3 id="Checking-the-submitted-work">Checking the submitted work<a class="anchor-link" href="#Checking-the-submitted-work"> </a></h3><p>To perform an assessment, you will need access to MATLAB and Simulink. For compatibility reasons, you should use the version of MATLAB that is installed on the shared University desktop. (Although newer versions of MATLAB will open older versions of Simulink files, the reverse is not true.) If you have problems running any files that are submitted, first check the note about file names below, and make any adjustments necessary. If you still have problems, note this in your feedback.</p>
<p>To perform a Peer Assessment you should visit each submission, review the claim form submitted and download the attached files. I would recommend that you create a folder for each submission. I would also recommend that you clear the MATLAB workspace (see command below) before testing each set of submitted files.</p>
<p><code>matlab
clear all</code></p>
<h3 id="Important-note-about-file-names">Important note about file names<a class="anchor-link" href="#Important-note-about-file-names"> </a></h3><p>Because files represent executable functions in MATLAB, the names you give to a file (before the prefix) has to be a valid <em>variable name</em> and obey the published rules (See <a href="https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/variable-names.html">Variable Names</a> in the MATLAB help documentation).</p>
<p>If you see an error dialogue like this:</p>
<p><img src="lab01/naming-error.png" alt="Naming error in MATLAB"></p>
<p>please rename the file so that it matches the rules that MATLAB uses to test that the variable name is valid:
<a href="https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/isvarname.html"><code>isvarname</code></a>.</p>
<p>You are most likely to see this error when executing a Simulink file or a ordinary script (<code>*.m</code>) file. Live Script files (<code>*.mlx</code>) will probably run without errors.</p>
<p>The reason I am stressing this is because Canvas may display a Simulink file as <code>single.slx</code> inside the grading system but it will have actually renamed your file to something like <code>anon_5j37y_536117_single-1.slx</code>. In a case like this, there will definitely be an error because of the <code>-1</code> in the file name. Canvas has added this because your peer made more than one submission. As a general rule, it is safest to <code>right-click</code> the link and use <code>save as</code> to save the file to disk before openining it in MATLAB rather than clicking the file inside Canvas and relying on the open feature of your operating system.</p>
<h3 id="Grading">Grading<a class="anchor-link" href="#Grading"> </a></h3><p>Use the grading rubric to <em>confirm</em> your peer's <em>self assessment</em>. It is important that you know that you are not marking the submission for <em>correctness</em>, only for <em>completeness</em> and the accuracy of the claim. You may may suggest a higher mark if you feel that your peer has done more than they are claiming and a lower one if you think they haven't done everything required. You <em>must</em> give a reason for your score if it does not agree with the student's own self-assessment.</p>
<p>I will have to moderate all grades and I will be checking at any disputed submissions. In the end, the final mark awarded will be my decision not yours!</p>
<h3 id="Feedback">Feedback<a class="anchor-link" href="#Feedback"> </a></h3><p>You should also provide feedback on the student's approach to the lab exercise. Your comments might include comments on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any problems you encountered checking your peer's submission (but please note the comment about <a href="#important_note_about_filenames">filenames</a> above).</li>
<li>Use of headings and sections to break up the Live Script documentation of the lab exercise.</li>
<li>Good use of textual comments in the Live Script file to explain the MATLAB code.</li>
<li>Things that the student did that you wish you had thought of.</li>
<li>Suggestions on what the student may do next time to clarify their approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the instructor will moderate all peer assessments before assigning the final grade.</p>
