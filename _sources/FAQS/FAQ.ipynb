    "*Fundamental frequency* -- A periodic signal $f(t) = f(t + nT),\\; n\\in \\mathbb{Z}$ has period $T$ s and a fundamental frequency $f_0 = 1/T$ Hz. When used in Fourier series and Fourier transforms, frequencies are expressed as $\\omega$ in radians/second. The **fundamental frequency** is $\\omega = \\Omega_0 = 2 \\pi f_0$ or, equivalently, $\\Omega_0 = 2 \\pi /T$ rad/s.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Harmonic frquencies* (or *Harmonics*) are simply integer multiples of the fundamental frequency $\\Omega_0$. So the zero-th harmonic is $\\Omega_0 = 0$ rad/s or DC. The first harmonic is $1.\\Omega_0 = \\Omega_0$, the second is $2 \\Omega_0$, the third $3 \\Omega_0$ etc. \n",
