    "> In signal processing, sampling is the reduction of a continuous-time signal to a discrete-time signal. A common example is the conversion of a sound wave (a continuous signal) to a sequence of samples (a discrete-time signal).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A sample is a value or set of values at a point in time and/or space.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A sampler is a subsystem or operation that extracts samples from a continuous signal.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A theoretical ideal sampler produces samples equivalent to the instantaneous value of the continuous signal at the desired points.\n",
