In {ref}`unit7.1` we looked at the MATLAB tools that can be used to design prototype analogue low-pass filters of various types, and introduced the MATLAB tools that design the prototypes and map them to high-pass, band-pass and band-stop filters. We also demostrated the tools needed to visualize the frequency response of such filters.

A the end of this process, we will have a transfer function $H(s)$ that defines the poles and zeros of an analogue filter which we now need to digitize for implementation.

In this unit, we will introduce one way to convert and analogue filter $H(s)$ into a digital filter $H(z)$ which is known as the bilinear transformation. We will give an example of a digital filter design for a second-order analogue filter. 

We will present the tools that MATLAB provides for the direct design of digital filters.

We will also look at the realization of such filters and give examples as Simulink block diagrams.

Finally we will present the Digital Filter Design block which allows the design of a filter directly in Simulink and supports the automatic generation of C-code or VHDL for digital filter design.

This unit is based on Sections 11.4-11.6 of {cite}`karris`.

**At the end of this unit you should be able to use the bilinear transform to convert a 2nd-order analogue proptotype into a digital filter and provide the coefficients for a block-diagram or code implementation of such a filter.**

To continue your learning we recommend that you visit the following pages on the MATLAB Documentation Platform:

* [Signal Processing](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/overview/signal-processing.html) [in MATLAB]
* [Signal Processing Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/signal/index.html) - signal analysis, analogue and digital filter design
* [DSP System Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/dsp/index.html) - for designing and implementing digital filters in Simulink and for code generation.

(unit7.2:digital)=
## Digital filters

A *digital filter* is a computational process (algorithm) that converts one sequence of numbers $x[n]$ representing the input, to another sequence $y[n]$ that represents the output.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

A digital filter can be used to filter out desired bands of frequency.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

Digital filters can also be used to perform other functions, such as integration, differentiation, and estimation.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

The input-output *difference equation* that relates the output and input can be expressed in the discrete-time (DT) domain as a summation of the form

$$y[n] = \sum_{i=0}^{k}b_i x[n - i]-\sum_{i=0}^{k}a_i y[n - i]$$ (eq:7.2:1)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

or, as a Z-transform as

$$H(z) = \frac{Y(z)}{X(z)} = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{k}b_i z^{-i}}{1 + \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{k}a_i z^{-i}}$$ (eq:7.2:2)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

Therefore, the design of a digital filter to perform a desired function, entails the determination of the coefficients $b_i$ and $a_i$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

(unit7.2:classification)=
### Classification of digital filters

Digital filters are classified in terms of the duration of the impulse response, and in terms of realization.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

#### 1. Impulse response duration

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

a). An *infinite impulse response* (IIR) filter as an infinite number of samples in its impulse response $h[n]$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

b). A *finite impulse response* (FIR) filter as a finite number of samples in its impulse response $h[n]$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

#### 2. Realization

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

a). In a *recursive realization* digital filter, the output depends on the input and the *previous* values of the output. In a recursive digital filter, both the coefficients $b_i$ and $a_i$ are present.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

b). In a *non-recursive realization* digital filter, the output depends on present and past values of the input only. In a non-recursive digital filter, only the coefficients $b_i$ are present, i.e. $a_i=0$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Implementation of digital filters

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

#### Recursive realization

{numref}`fig:u72:1` shows a Simulink model of a third-order (3-delay element or 3-tap) recursive realization of a digital filter[^u72:note:1]

```{code-cell}

```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

[^u72:note:1]: Note that the block labelled $z^{-1}$ is a one unit delay $y[n] = x[n - 1]$; the triangular blocks are gains $y[n] = k x[n]$; and the circular blocks are summing points. Following the equations we have $w[n] = x[n] - a_1 w[n-1] - a_2 w[n-2] - a_3 w[n-3]$ and $y[n] = b_0 w[n] + b_1 w[n-1] + b_2 w[n-2] + b_3 w[n-3]$. It is left as an exercise for the reader to show that combining these two equations, taking Z-transforms, and eliminating $W(z)$, results in the transfer function $H(z) = Y(z)/X(z)$ given in {eq}`eq:7.2:2` and hence the difference equation of {eq}`eq:7.2:1`.

### Digital filter design methods

As demonstrated in {ref}`unit7.1`, filter-design methods have been established and analogue prototypes have been published. Thus, we can choose an appropriate analogue prototype to satisfy the requirements.

Transformation methods are also available to transform analogue prototypes into an equivalent digital filter.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

Three commonly used transformation methods are

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

#### 1. The *impulse invariant method*

Produces a digital filter $H(z)$ whose impulse response consists of the sampled values of the impulse response of the equivalent analogue filter $H(s)$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

This is implemented in MATLAB by the system transformation function: `Hz = c2d(Hs,Ts,'impulse')` where `Hs` is the analogue transfer function $H(s)$, `Ts` is the sampling period, and `Hz` is the equivalent $H(z)$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

#### 2. The *step invariant method*

Produces a digital filter $H(z)$ whose step response consists of the sampled values of the step response of the equivalent analogue filter $H(s)$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

#### 3. The *bilinear transformation method*

This uses the transformation[^u72:note:3]

$$s = \frac{2}{T_s}\cdot\frac{z-1}{z+1}$$ (eq:7.2:3)

to transform the left-half of the $s$-plane into the interior of the unit circle in the $z$-plane.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

[^u72:note:3]: $T_s$ is the sampling period, that is the reciprocal of the sampling frequency $f_s$ Hz.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

In this unit, we will discuss, *and assess*, only the use of the blinear transformation.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

(unit7.2:bilinear)=
## The Bilinear Transformation

We recall from {ref}`s-to-z` that since $z = e^{sT_s}$, $s = 1/T_s \log_e z$, then a DT transfer function $H(z)$ can be determined from a CT transfer function $H(s)$ using the mapping:

$$H(z) = \left.H(s)\right|_{s = \frac{1}{T_s} \log_e z}$$ (eq:7.2:4)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

But the relation $s = 1/T_s \log_e z$ is a multi-valued transformation, and as such, cannot be used to derive a rational polynomial in $z$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

It can be approximated as

$$s = \frac{1}{T_s} \log_e z = \frac{2}{T_s} \left[\frac{z-1}{z+1}  + \frac{1}{3} \left(\frac{z-1}{z+1} \right)^3 + \frac{1}{5} \left(\frac{z-1}{z+1} \right)^5 + \frac{1}{7} \left(\frac{z-1}{z+1} \right)^7 + \cdots\right]$$

$$s \approx \frac{2}{T_s} \cdot \frac{z-1}{z+1} $$ (eq:7.2:5)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

Substitution of {eq}`eq:7.2:5` into {eq}`eq:7.2:4` yields

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

$$H(z) = \left.G(s)\right|_{s = \frac{2}{T_s} \cdot \frac{z-1}{z+1}} $$ (eq:7.2:6)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

(unit7.2:freqz)=
### Digital frequency response of the bilinear transformation

The digital frequency response (using $\omega_d$ on the unit circle in the $z$-plane) is obtained by the substitution $z = e^{j\omega_d T_s}$, giving

$$H\left(e^{j\omega_d T_s}\right) = H\left(\frac{2}{T_s} \cdot \frac{e^{j\omega_d T_s } - 1}{e^{j\omega_d T_s } + 1} \right) $$ (eq:7.2:7)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

Since the $z\to s$ transformation maps the unit circle on the $z$-plane into the $j\omega$ axis on the $s$-plane, the quantity

$$\frac{2}{T_s} \cdot \frac{e^{j\omega_d T_s } - 1}{e^{j\omega_d T_s} + 1}$$

and $j\omega$ must be equal to some point $\omega = \omega_a$ on the $j\omega$ axis.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

That is,

$$j\omega_a = \frac{2}{T_s} \cdot \frac{e^{j\omega_d T_s } - 1}{e^{j\omega_d T_s } + 1}$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

or

$$\omega_a = \frac{1}{J} \cdot \frac{2}{T_s} \cdot \frac{e^{j\omega_d T_s } - 1}{e^{j\omega_d T_s } + 1} = \frac{2}{T_s}\cdot \frac{1/(j2)}{1/2} \cdot \frac{e^{j\omega_d T_s/2} - e^{-j\omega_d T_s/2}}{e^{j\omega_d T_s/2} + e^{-j\omega_d T_s/2}}$$

$$\omega_a = \frac{2}{T_s} \cdot \frac{\sin\left(\omega_d T_s\right)/2}{\cos\left(\omega_d T_s\right)/2} $$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

or

$$\omega_a = \frac{2}{T_s} \tan\left(\frac{\omega_d T_s}{2} \right)$$ (eq:7.2:8)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

(u72:warping)=
### Frequency warping of the bilinear transformation

We see that the analogue frequency to digital frequency transformation results in a non-linear mapping; this condition is know as *warping*.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

For instance, the frequency range $0 \lt \omega_a \le \infty$ the analogue frequency is warped into the range $0 \le \omega_d \le \pi/T_s$ in digital frequency.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

 To express $\omega_d$ in terms of $\omega_a$, we rewrite {eq}`eq:7.2:8` as
 
 $$\tan\left(\frac{\omega_d T_s}{2} \right) = \frac{\omega_a T_s}{2} $$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

Then,

 $$\omega_d T_s  = 2 \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\omega_a T_s}{2}\right) $$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

and for small $\omega_a T_s/2$,

$$\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\omega_a T_s}{2}\right) \approx \frac{\omega_a T_s}{2}$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

Therefore,

$$\omega_d T_s \approx 2 \left(\frac{\omega_a T_s}{2}\right) \approx \omega_a T_s$$  (eq:7.2:9)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

that is, for small frequencies,

$$\omega_d \approx \omega_a$$ (eq:7.2:10)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

In MATLAB, $z$ is a function of normalized frequency and thus the range of frequencies in $H(z)$ is from $0 \to \pi$. Then {eq}`eq:7.2:9`, when used with MATLAB, becomes

$$\omega_d \approx \frac{\omega_a T_s}{\pi} $$ (eq:7.2:11)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

(u72:pre-warping)=
### Pre-warping

The effect of warping can be eliminated by *pre-warping* the analogue filter prior to the application of the bilinear transformation. This is acomplished with the use of {eq}`eq:7.2:8`.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

(u72:ex:12)=
#### Example 12

Compute the transfer function $H(z)$ of a low-pass filter with $3$ dB cutoff frequency at $20$ Hz, and attenuation of at least $10$ dB for frequencies greater than $40$ Hz. The sampling frequency $f_s = 200$ Hz. Compare the magnitude plot with that obtained by a low-pass analogue filter with the same specifications.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

##### Solution

We will apply the bilinear transformation. We arbitrarily choose a second-order Butterworth filter which will meet the stop-band specification.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

The transfer function $H(s)$ of the analogue low-pass filter with normalized frequency at $\omega_c = 1$ rad/s is found with the MATLAB `buttap` function as follows:

```{code-cell}
---
slideshow:
  slide_type: fragment
---
 [z,p,k] = buttap(2); [b,a] = zp2tf(z,p,k)
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

Thus, the transfer function with noramlized frequency, denoted as $H_n(s)$, is

$$H_n(s) = \frac{1}{s^2 + 1.414 s + 1} $$ (eq:7.2:12)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

Now, we must transform this transfer function to another with actual cutoff frequency at $20$ Hz. We donote it as $H_a(s)$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

We will first pre-warp the analogue frequency which by relation {eq}`eq:7.2:8`, us related to the digital frequency as

$$\omega_a = \frac{2}{T_s}\tan\left(\frac{\omega_d T_s}{2} \right)$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

where

$$T_s = \frac{1}{f_s} = \frac{1}{200}.$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

Denoting the analogue cutoff (3 dB) frequency as $\omega_{ac}$, we obtain

$$\omega_{ac} = 400 \tan \left(\frac{2\pi\times 20}{2\times 200} \right) = 400\tan\left(0.1\pi\right) \approx 130\,\mathrm{rad/s}$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

or

$$f_{ac} = \frac{130}{2\pi} \approx 20.69\,\mathrm{Hz}.$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

As expected from relation {eq}`eq:7.2:10`, this frequency is very close to the discrete-time frequency $f_{dc} = 20$ Hz, and thus from {eq}`eq:7.2:12`,

$$H_a(s) \approx H_n(s) = \frac{1}{s^2 + 1.414 s + 1} $$ (eq:7.2:12)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

Relation {eq}`eq:7.2:12` applies only when the cutoff frequency is normalized to $\omega_c = 1$ rad/s.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

If $\omega_c \ne 1$, we must scale the transfer function in accordance with relation {eq}`eq:7.1:15`, that is,

$$H(s)_\mathrm{actual} = H\left(\frac{s}{\omega_\mathrm{actual}} \right) $$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

For this example, $\omega_\mathrm{actual} = 130$ rad/s, and thus we replace $s$ with $s/130$ and we obtain

$$H_a(s) = \frac{1}{\left(s/130\right)^2 + 1.414s/130 + 1} $$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

We will use MATLAB to simplify this expression

```{code-cell}
---
slideshow:
  slide_type: fragment
---
syms s; simplifyFraction(1/((s/130)^2 + 1.414*s/130 + 1))
845000/50
9191/50
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

Then,

$$H_a(s) = \frac{845000}{50s^2 + 9191s + 845000} = \frac{16900}{s^2 + 183.82s + 16900} $$ (eq:7.2:13)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

and making the substitution of $s = (2/T_s)(z -1)/(z + 1) = 400(z-1)/(z + 1)$ we obtain

$$H(z) = \frac{16900}{\left(400\cdot \frac{z-1}{z + 1}\right)^2 + \frac{183.82\times 400(z-1)}{(z + 1)} + 16900} $$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

We use the MATLAB code below to simplify this expression

```{code-cell}
---
slideshow:
  slide_type: fragment
---
syms z; simplify(16900/((400*(z-1)/(z+1))^2 + 183.82*400*(z - 1)/(z + 1) + 16900))
```

```{code-cell}
---
slideshow:
  slide_type: fragment
---
expand(4225*(z + 1)^2)
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

and thus

$$H(z) = \frac{4225z^2 + 8450z + 4225}{62607z^2 - 71550z + 25843} $$ (eq:7.2:14)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

We will used the MATLAB [`freqz`](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/freqz.html) function to plot the magnitude of $H(z)$, but we must first express it in negative powers of $z$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

 Dividing each term of {eq}`eq:7.2:14` by $62607z^2$, we obtain
 
 $$\frac{0.0675 + 0.1350z^{-1} + 0.0675z^{-2}}{1 - 1.1428z^{-1} + 0.4128 z^{-2}}$$ (eq:7.2:15)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

The MATLAB script below will generate $H(z)$ and will plot the magnitude of this transfer function.

```{code-cell}
---
slideshow:
  slide_type: fragment
---
az = [1,  -1.1428, 0.4128]; bz = [0.0675, 0.1350, 0.0675]; fs = 200; fc = 20;
[Hz, wT] = freqz(bz,az,fc,fs);
semilogx(wT,20*log10(abs(Hz))); xlabel('Frequency in Hz - log scale')
ylabel('Magnitude (dB)'), title('Digital Low-Pass Filter. Example 12'),grid
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

We now plot the analogue equivalent to compare the digital to the analogue frequency response.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

The MATLAB script below produces the desired plot.

```{code-cell}
---
slideshow:
  slide_type: fragment
---
[z,p,k] = buttap(2); [b, a] = zp2tf(z,p,k); f = 1:1:100; fc = 20; [bn,an] = lp2lp(b,a,fc);
Hs = freqs(bn,an,f);
semilogx(f, 20*log10(abs(Hs))), xlabel('Frequency in Hz - log scale')
ylabel('Magnitude (dB)'), title('Analogue Low-Pass Filter. Example 12'),grid
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

Comparing the digital filter plot with the equivalent analogue filter plot, we observe that the magnitude is greater than $-3$ dB for frequencies less than $20$ rad/s, and is smaller than $-10$ dB for frequencies greater than $40$ Hz. Therefore, both the digital and analogue low-pass filters meet the specified requirements.[^u72:note:4]

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

[^u72:note:4]: Note the significant distortion of the digital filter response at high frequencies.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

(u72:matlab_bilinear)=
### MATLAB bilinear function

An analogue filter transfer function can be mapped to a digital transfer function directly with the MATLAB [`bilinear`](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/bilinear.html) function. The procedure is illustrated with the following example.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

(u72:ex:13)=
#### Example 13

Use the MATLAB `bilinear` function to derive the low-pass digital transfer function $H(z)$ from a second-order Butterworth analogue filter with a $3$ dB cutoff frequency at $50$ Hz, and sample rate $f_s = 500$ Hz.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

##### Solution

We will use the following MATLAB script to produce the desired digital filter function:

```{code-cell}
---
slideshow:
  slide_type: fragment
---
[z,p,k] = buttap(2); [num,den] = zp2tf(z,p,k); fc = 50; wc = 2*pi*fc;
[num1,den1] = lp2lp(num,den,wc);
fs = 500; [numd,dend] = bilinear(num1, den1, fs)
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

Therefore, the transfer function $H(z)$ for this filter is

$$H(z) = \frac{0.0640 z^2  +  0.1279 z +   0.0640}{z^2   -1.1683 z +    0.4241} = \frac{0.0640  +  0.1279 z^{-1} +   0.0640 z^{-2}}{1   -1.1683 z^{-1} +    0.4241 z^{-2}}$$ (eq:7.2:16)

## Digital Filter Design with Simulink

As stated earlier in this unit, a digital filter is a computational process, or algorithm, that converts one sequence of numbers representing the input signal into another sequence of numbers representing the output signal.

To close out this unit and the module, we will explore Simulink models that can be used to implement digital filters, and present the *Digital Filter Design* block included in the [Simulink DSP System Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/dsp/index.html), which can generate these models automatically.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

At the summing junction of {numref}`fig:u72:3` we obtain

$$b_0X(z)+b_1z^{-1}X(z)+b_2z^{-2}X(z) + \left(-a_1\right)z^{-1}Y(z) + \left(-a_1\right)z^{-2}Y(z) = Y(z)$$

$$X(z)\left(b_0 + b_1z^{-1} + b_2z^{-2}\right) = Y(s)\left(1 + a_1z^{-1} + a_2z^{-2}\right)$$

And thus, the transfer function of the Direct Form I Realization of the second-order digital filter of {numref}`fig:u72:3` is

$$H(z) = \frac{Y(z)}{X(z)} = \frac{b_0 + b_1z^{-1} + b_2z^{-2}}{1 + a_1z^{-1} + a_2z^{-2}} $$ (eq:7.2:21)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

A disadvantage of the Direct Form I Realization digital filter is that it requires $2k$ registers where $k$ represents the order of the filter. We observe that the second-order ($k=2$) digital filter of {numref}`fig:u72:3` requires 4 delay (register) elements denoted as $z^{-1}$. However, this form of realization has the advantage that there is no possibility of internal filter overflow[^u72:notes:5].

The transfer function for the Direct Form-II second-order digital filter of {numref}`fig:u72:4` is the same as for a Direct Form-I second-order filter of {numref}`fig:u72:3`, that is,

$$H(z) = \frac{b_0 + b_1z^{-1} + b_2z^{-2}}{1 + a_1z^{-1} + a_2z^{-2}} $$ (eq:7.2:22)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

A comparison of {eq}`eq:7.2:21` and {eq}`eq:7.2:22` shows that whereas a Direct Form-I second-order digital filter requires $2k$ registers, where $k$ represents the order of the filter, a Direct Type-II second-order digital filter requires only $k$ register elements denoted as $z^{-1}$. This is because the register ($z^{-1}$) elements of the Direct Form-II realization are shared between the zeros section and the poles section.

As with the Series Form Realization, the ordering of the individual filters in {numref}`fig:u72:8` is immaterial.

$$\frac{H(z)}{z}  = \frac{0.5\left(z+0.6\right)\left(z-0.6\right)}{z\left(z+0.9\right)\left(z-0.8\right)} $$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

Next we perform partial fraction expansion

$$\frac{0.5\left(z+0.6\right)\left(z-0.6\right)}{z\left(z+0.9\right)\left(z-0.8\right)} = \frac{r_1}{z} + \frac{r_2}{z+0.9} + \frac{r_2}{z-0.8} $$

$$r_1 = \left.\frac{0.5\left(z+0.6\right)\left(z-0.6\right)}{\left(z+0.9\right)\left(z-0.8\right)}\right|_{z=0} = 0.25$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

$$r_2 = \left.\frac{0.5\left(z+0.6\right)\left(z-0.6\right)}{z\left(z-0.8\right)}\right|_{z=-0.9} = 0.147$$
