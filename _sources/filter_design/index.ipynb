    "# Unit 7: Analogue and Digital Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final section we will present a brief overview of filters and filter design. \n",
    "\n",
    "In {ref}`unit7.1` the aim is for you to be able to recognise the frequency response of the commonly used filter types; to be able to discuss the approach taken for analogue model filter design. We will demonstrate the magitude-squared representation used to design the poles and zeros of a low-pass filter and we will examine the Butterworth, Chebyshev and Elliptical filters. We will also demonstrate the analogue low-pass filter design tools, and filter transformation tools provided by MATLAB.\n",
    "\n",
    "In {ref}`unit7.2` we will discuss the architecture of finite-impulse response (FIR) and infinite-impulse response (IIR) digital filters. We will demonstrate the bilinear transform which is used to convert a continuous-time (analogue) filter to a discete-time filter; and we will demonstrate how such a filter can be represented in Simulink.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also demonstrate the filter design tool and filter comparison tools provided by the Signal Processing Toolbox ({cite}`matlab_spt`. We will also look at the options that MATLAB provides for simulating digital signal processing applications in Simulink and using code generation for the implementation of filter designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope and Background Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very large topic and we will give a fairly high-level overview. Much more detail is available in the references for this Unit which are Chapter 11 of {cite}`karris` and {cite}`matlab_filter_design`.\n",
