# Unit 7: Analogue and Digital Filters

In this final section we will present a brief overview of filters and filter design. 

In {ref}`unit7.1` the aim is for you to be able to recognise the frequency response of the commonly used filter types; to be able to discuss the approach taken for analogue model filter design; to be able to apply the bilinear transform to convert a continuous-time (analogue) filter to a discete-time infinite impulse response (IIR) filter; and the be able to explain how such a filter would be represented in Simulink.

In {ref}`unit7.2` we will demonstrate the various analogue and digital filter design tools provided by MATLAB and the filter design tool and filter comparison tools provided by the Signal Processing Toolbox ({cite}`matlab_spt`. We will also look at the options that MATLAB provides for simulating digital signal processing applications in Simulink and using code generation for filter designs implimentation.

## Scope and Background Reading

This is a very large topic and we will give a fairly high-level overview. Much more detail is available in the references for this Unit which are Chapter 11 of {cite}`karris` and {cite}`matlab_filter_design`.
