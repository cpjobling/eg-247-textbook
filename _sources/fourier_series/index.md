# Unit 3: Fourier Series

This chapter launches our Introduction to Fourier Transforms with a look at Wave Analysis and Trigonometric Fourier Series. We will then go on to consider the Exponential Fourier Series and its Applications.

The material in this chapter is based on Chapter 7 (Starting at [Section 7.8](http://site.ebrary.com/lib/swansea/docDetail.action?docID=10547416)) of {cite}`karris` from the Required Reading List. Some clarificattion was needed and I used [Chapter 4](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/swansea-ebooks/reader.action?ppg=150&docID=3135971&tm=1518703383001) of {cite}`boulet` from the Recommended Reading List for this.

## Contents

In this section of the course we will cover:

* {ref}`trig_fseries`
* {ref}`exp_fs1`
* {ref}`exp_fs2`
* {ref}`unit3.4`

## References

See [Bibliography](/zbib).
