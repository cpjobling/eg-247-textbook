    "4. Convolution of two 1024 real sequences takes 1,048,576 real\toperations.\tFFT\tof each\tsignal takes 10,240 complex\toperations,\tmultiplication of two signals in complex domain\ttakes 1,024\tcomplex\tmultiplications, inverse FFT is\t10,240 more. So\t FFT method\tis around 31,000 complex operations. Even if taking\tinto account difference\tbetween complex\tand\treal arithmetic, FFT is\torder 10 times faster (and needs less memory) than convolution.\n",
