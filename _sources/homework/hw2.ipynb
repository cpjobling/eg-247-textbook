    "We will distribute this PDF to the _Homework_ section of your personal section of the **OneNote Class Notebook** then you can use the *ink feature* (if supported) to hand-write or sketch your answers. You may wish to use MATLAB to solve or check your solutuons to some of these problems. You may include your MATLAB solutions as extra items in your records for [Lab 2](../labs/lab02/index).\n",
