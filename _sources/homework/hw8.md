# Homework 8

## Sampling Theory and the Z-Transform

### Sampling Theory

You should take the scripts home ([to be found here](https://github.com/cpjobling/eg-247-textbook/tree/master/dt_systems/1/matlab)) and play with them.

* Try increasing the sampling frequency: 8000 Hz, 11025 Hz, 22050 Hz, 44100 Hz, 48000 Hz, and 96000 Hz are supported by most PC sound cards.
* Try increasing the bits per sample: 8, 16, 24 are available.

### Z-Transform

Problems 1 to 3 inÂ [Section 9.10 Exercises](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/swansea-ebooks/reader.action?docID=3384197&ppg=329) of Karris{cite}`karris` explore the z-Transform.
