This is the Introduction to the EG-247 module. It contains the source code for the notes and the illustrative Matlab files used in the body of the notes and demonstrated in the first lecture.

The notes are contained in a [Jupyter notebook](http://ipython.org/index.html). They are interactive if you have the [Jupyter notebook installed](http://jupyter.org/install.html). Otherwise, you can view a read-only version ([Introduction](https://cpjobling.github.io/eg-247-textbook/introduction/index.html)) from the [textbook](https://cpjobling.github.io/eg-247-textbook).
