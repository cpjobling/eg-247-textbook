    "The lab component will be assessed based on a portfolio of the MATLAB scripts, Simulink models and publishable MATLAB Live Scripts. You should therefore aim to keep all the files from each lab session in a suitable folder in your workspace on your OneDrive. I would suggest a structure like **eg-247-textbook\\portfolio\\lab01** which matches the layout of the files on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cpjobling/eg-247-textbook/tree/master/portfolio).\n",
    "\n",
    "One elegant way to do this would be to fork this GitHub repository ([cpjobling/eg-247-textbook](https://github.com/cpjobling/eg-247-textbook)) and then build on from there, but that is not necessary.\n",

    "If you do not use GitHub as the master repository of your portfolio, please ensure that you backup your work files regularly. You will be required to submit some or all of them for assessment."

    "1. Explore the properties of the unit step and Dirac delta functions using the analysis and plotting tools  provided by MATLAB in the *Symbolic Math Toolbox*.\n",
    "1. Synthesise a generalised signal in Simulink and plot it and its derivative.\n",
    "1. Experience **Peer Assessment** as a coursework moderation and feedback process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will introduce the symbolic toolbox and the `heaviside`, `delta` and `ezplot` functions provided by MATLAB  and the *signal design block*, *multiplexer*, *scope* and *derivative* blocks provided by Simulink for the simulation of continuous time signals and systems.\n",
