    "## Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to build and test a Simulink model of a single stage peaking filter for a ten-stage graphic equalizer. MATLAB can be employed to design the required filters and then Simulink can be used to simulate the graphic equaliser in real time. Most commercial equalisers use either 1/3 octave or 2/3 octave bandpass filters but to keep this from becoming too large we will employ one octave bandpass filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "These papers: {cite:t}`bohn87` and {cite:t}`bohn2008` may help to set the scene and have information on how to perform the necessary calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using peaking filters as described in Mark Wickert's articles: [Signals and Systems Concepts Used to Design an Audio Graphic Equalizer](https://www.dummies.com/education/science/science-engineering/11-signals-and-systems-concepts-used-to-design-an-audio-graphic-equalizer/?keyword=graphic%20equalizer&index=4&isSearch=1) and [How to Characterize the Peaking Filter for an Audio Graphic Equalizer](https://www.dummies.com/education/science/science-engineering/how-to-characterize-the-peaking-filter-for-an-audio-graphic-equalizer/) from the [Engineering for Dummies](https://www.dummies.com/education/science/science-engineering/) resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "The filter parameters that you will use will be computed based on your student number and will be unique to you. You *must* use these parameters in your design.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided a worksheet for you in the form of a MATLAB Live Script file [graphic_eq.mlx](https://github.com/cpjobling/eg-247-textbook/blob/master/labs/project/graphic_eq.mlx). This worksheet provides full instructions on how to perform the calculations needed to complete the project and a marking scheme which you can use for self assessment. Once you have completed the calculations and answered the questions in the worksheet, you should build the filter in Simulink and test it using the methods similar to those shown in [Conduct Performance Testing on an Audio Graphic Equalizer](https://www.dummies.com/education/science/science-engineering/conduct-performance-testing-on-an-audio-graphic-equalizer/).\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit this worksheet and submit it with your claim and the simulink model with test setup by the deadline which is **4:00 pm on Friday 5th May 2023**."
