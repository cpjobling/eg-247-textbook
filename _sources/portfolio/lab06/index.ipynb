    "## Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is an introduction to signal processing with MATLAB. It will help to familiarize you with some of the main functions to read in and play sound files in MATLAB. It also looks at the ideas of aliasing and anti-aliasing filters that is key to the successful conversion from continuous to discrete time signals and systems. It is therefore an opportunity to try some basic digital signal processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also look at a one application of digital signals processing which is simple sound synthesis."

    "#### Part 1: Read and Store an Audio File in Matlab\n",
    "\n",
    "To read and store an audio file, you can use one of two different commands. The following stores the file into variable `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```matlab\n",
    "x = audioread('filename');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless the audio file is in the same folder as the script, you will need to include the entire filename including the directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: `C:\\My Documents\\EG-247-Lab\\portfolio\\lab06\\Audio.wav`\n",
    "\n",
    "The command below stores the audio file into variable `x` and the sampling frequency in variable `Fs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```matlab\n",
    "[x,Fs] = audioread('filename');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 2: Play the Audio File\n",
    "\n",
    "To play an audio file in MATLAB you use the `sound()` function. The following function plays the sound. If the `Fs` variable is not defined or included in the command, it will assume the default sample rate of 8192 Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "```matlab\n",
    "sound(x,Fs);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the PC lab, the speakers may have been disabled. But even if they are not, it will probably be best if you use head phones with either a standard 3.5 mm phone socket or USB connection to hear the sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 3: Audio Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "To scale an audio file the `sound()` command is used. This allows for the modification of an audio signal’s amplitude or frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "```matlab\n",
    "sound(x,Fs);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To increase the volume of the audio track you can multiply the variable it is stored in by a scalar. To slow down or speed up the track played you can adjust the sampling rate. Comment on your observations using different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now experiment with different bit values (8,16,24) in the following command:\n",
    "```matlab\n",
    "sound(x,Fs,bits);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment on your observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 4: Playing a Sound Backwards\n",
    "\n",
    "The command to reverse the order of the samples in a matrix is `flipud()`. Experiment with this command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Record your experiments in this part of the lab by saving your Live Script file. Include your thoughts and observations as text elements."

    "## Miniproject 3:  Composing Music in MATLAB (1 mark)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab exercise, we explore how to use simple tones to compose a segment of music. By using tones of various frequencies, you will construct the first few bars of Beethoven's famous piece Symphony No. 5 in C-Minor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**: Each musical note can be simply represented by a sinusoid whose frequency depends on the note pitch. Assume a sampling rate of 8KHz and that an eighth note = 0.125s (1000 samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "Musical notes are arranged in groups of twelve notes called octaves. The notes that we'll be using for Beethoven's Fifth are in the octave containing frequencies from 220 Hz to 440 Hz. The twelve notes in each octave are logarithmically spaced in frequency, with each note being of a frequency 2<sup>1/12</sup> times the frequency of the note of lower frequency. Thus, a 1-octave pitch shift corresponds to a doubling of the frequencies of the notes in the original octave. Table 1 shows the ordering of notes in the octave to be used to synthesize the opening of Beethoven's fifth, as well as the fundamental frequencies for these notes. Note the notes without subscripts, correspond to the white keys on a piano. The notes with subscripts - called respective sharp (♯) and flat (♭) - represent the black keys."

    "A musical score is essentially a plot of frequencies (notes, on the vertical scale for you musician types) versus time (measures, on the horizontal scale). The musical sequence of notes to the piece you will synthesize is given in Figure 1. The following discussion identifies how musical scores can be mapped to tones of specific pitch and duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case, each note may be represented by a burst of a sinusoid followed by a shorter period of silence (a pause). The pauses allow us to distinguish between separate notes of the same pitch. The horizontal lines in Figure 1 represent the notes E, G, B, D, F from the bottom to the top. The spaces between the lines are used to represent the notes F, A, C, and E, again from the bottom to the top. Note that A-G only yields seven notes; the additional notes are due to changes in pitch called sharps (denoted by the symbol ♯) or flats (denoted by the symbol ♭) that follows a given note. A sharp increases the pitch by 2<sup>1/12</sup> and flat decreases the pitch by 2<sup>1/12</sup>.\n",

    "![Musical Score for Beethoven's Fifth](music.png)\n",
    "Figure 1: Musical Score for Beethoven's Fifth\n",
    "\n",
    "In the musical score in Figure 1, the first three eighth notes are all note G. The first half note is an E♭ due to the inclusion of the three flat symbols at the left of the score, since we are in the key of C-minor. After the half note, the symbol is a rest of length equal to the duration of an eighth note. The next three eighth notes are all F, and the final half note is a D. You can get the fundamental frequencies for these notes from Table 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note Durations\n",
    "\n",
    "The duration of each note burst is determined by whether the note is a whole note, half note, quarter note, eight note, etc. Obviously, a quarter note has twice the duration of an eighth note, and so on. So your half notes should be four times the duration of your eighth notes. The short pause you use to follow each note should be of the same duration regardless of the length of the note.\n",

    "#### Creating Music in MATLAB\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of the lab will teach you how to create music using different tones created in MATLAB.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we are going to code a sine wave of amplitude A = 1, at an audio frequency of 220 * 7/12  Hz (which corresponds to E<sup>♭</sup>) which plays for an eighth note (0.125 seconds).\n",
    "\n",
    "```matlab\n",
    "Fs = 8000;\n",
    "Ts = 1/Fs;\n",
    "Eflat = sin(2*pi*220 * 2^(6/12) .*[0:Ts:0.125]);\n",
    "sound(Eflat);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This vector `Eflat` now contains samples of the sine wave from t = 0s to t = 0.125s, in samples that are spaced `Ts` seconds apart. Note that this sampling interval corresponds to a sampling frequency of 8 kHz (1/Ts = fs) and Ts will be 0.125 ms. This is standard for voice grade audio channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a pause use the zeros function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```matlab\n",
    "pause = zeros(1,length(0:Ts:time));\n",
    "```\n",
    "For example to create an eighth note pause at the start of the tune:\n",
    "\n",
    "```matlab\n",
    "pause8th = zeros(1,length(0:Ts:0.125));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to write this pause and first note sound to a sound file we use the following command:\n",
    "```matlab\n",
    "audiowrite('first_note.wav',[pause8th,Eflat],Fs);\n",
    "```\n",
    "To play the sound, use the `sound()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can complete the opening phrase of Beethoven's fifth by adding additional notes and pauses of the correct length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the commands you use to create, play and save your version of Beethoven's Fifth in a MATLAB mlx-file as `beethoven.mlx` and add this to your copy of this lab script along with the sound file."
