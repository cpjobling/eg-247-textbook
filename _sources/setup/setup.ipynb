    "I have used Jupyter notebooks for **EG-247 Digital Signal Processing** for a number of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I can easily produce maths-rich textbook quality notes using the Markdown system provided for documentation blocks.\n",
    "1. I can generate a slide-show from my notes but also print them as PDF files for your convenience.\n",
    "1. I can interweave live coding examples with my notes and execute and change these examples in a live classroom.\n",
    "1. ... more interestingly, you can take the notebooks and experiment with the computing examples yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to fully access all the examples that have been provided as Jupyter notebooks for EG-247 you will need to install both MATLAB (I used MATLAB 2019a) and Python 3 (I used Anaconda 3) and this is something of a technical challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The installation of Anaconda 3 (which includes Jupyter Notebook) and MATLAB is [described elsewhere](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) but must be done before you can open and execute this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that you *have* installed Anaconda 3, you can [download](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/blob/master/setup/setup.ipynb) and open this notebook using the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter notebook setup.ibynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use the **Anaconda Navigator** to launch a Jupyter Notebook and then navigate to the `setup.ipynb` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** for Windows users, you need to start jupyter as an Administrator.  "

All allow the mixing of code with output, the running of code in sections, and the ability to add formatted text, images, and equations to tell a story and provide a repeatable record of a computation. \n",

Other teachers have also advocated the use of Live Script in teaching, e.g. [Teaching with Matlab Live Scripts](https://bastibe.de/2016-06-15-matlab-live-scripts.html). The main issue though is that MATLAB is an expensive, licensed product. It's free to use while you are a student or a teacher at Swansea University. It is extremely expensive once you graduate!\n",
