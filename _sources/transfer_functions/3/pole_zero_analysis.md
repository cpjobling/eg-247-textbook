## Transfer function representation of a DC motor

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

Another essential electric vehicle (EV) component is the DC motor.

![Simplified EV schematic](images/engineFocus.png)

Simplified EV schematic

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

The purpose of the DC motor is to convert electrical energy to mechanical. The mechanical energy is manifested as a torque on the drive shaft. This torque is converted to a traction force by the wheels, which causes the vehicle to move.

![Motor highlighted in a simple EV systemt](images/EVSimpleSystemMotorHighlight.png)

The DC motor bridges the electrical and physical domains.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

A DC motor works by conducting a current through an armature that can rotate freely. The fixed brushes transmit the current to the rotating commutators. The current flowing through the armature passes through a magnetic field generated by the stator magnets, resulting in a Lorentz force in the perpendicular direction ($\mathbf{F} = i\mathbf{\ell} \times \mathbf{B}$, where $\mathbf{\ell}$ points in the wire direction). The two sides of the armature each produce a force, resulting in a net torque on the rotor $T$. If sufficient torque is applied, the shaft rotates, changing the angular position $\theta$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

![A schematic diagram of a DC motor](images/motorDiagram.png)

DC motor schematic. A net torque $T$ is generated on the armature by Lorentz forces. In the electrical domain, the motor is represented by a series of three circuit elements.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Derivation of the DC motor differential equations

Under typical operating conditions, the torque generated by a DC motor is directly proportional to the current passing $i$ through it:

$$T = k_mi$$

where $k_m$ is a proportionality constant determined by the characteristics of the specific motor. This relationship fails for large values of $i$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

When the armature rotates, it generates a back electromotive force ([back EMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-electromotive_force)) that opposes the applied voltage. In the circuit diagram, this is represented by a motor symbol. The voltage drop due to the back EMF, denoted $e$, is proportional to the rotational velocity of the armature:

$$e =k_e \dot{\theta}$$

where $k_e$ is a constant of proportionality. To derive the relationship between the current $i$ and the motor shaft angular position $\theta$, you can apply Kirchhoff's voltage law and Newton's second law in terms of torques acting on the motor shaft.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

Kirchhoff's voltage law implies that the sum of the voltage drops across the circuit must equal the applied voltage:

$$
iR + L \frac{di}{dt} + k_e \dot{\theta} = v
$$ (eq1)

where $v$ is the electric potential applied to the motor.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

In the absence of other applied torques, the equation of motion can be derived by balancing the inertia of the motor shaft ($J \ddot{\theta}$) with the applied torque ($T$) and frictional resistance ($B \dot{\theta}$).


$$

J \ddot{\theta} = T - B \dot{\theta}

$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

Using the linear relationship between torque and current, this is equivalent to:


$$

J \ddot{\theta} + B \dot{\theta} = k_m i

$$
(eq2)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Exercise 1

![exercise](images/write.png)

In this exercise, you will compute transfer functions of the DC motor system. Assume that the system starts at rest ($i = i' = \theta = \dot{\theta} = 0$). Also, assume that the applied voltage is a function of time $v = v(t)$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## Pole analysis
You can gain insight into the characteristics of a dynamic system without actually solving it by analyzing the form of its transfer function. The poles of the transfer function offer the most insight.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

**Definition**. The **poles** of a rational transfer function occur where the denominator is zero. Consider a rational transfer function in factored form:


$$

G(s) = K \frac{ (s-z_1)(s-z_2) \ldots (s-z_m) }{ (s-p_1)(s-p_2) \ldots (s-p_n)}

$$

The poles are $p_1$, $p_2$, $\ldots$, $p_n$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Stability
The real parts of the poles determine the stability of the system.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

1. A pole with a positive real part ($\text{Re}(p_i) > 0$) characterizes an exponential growth component of the solution.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

2. A pole with a negative real part ($\text{Re}(p_i) < 0$) characterizes an exponential decay component of the solution.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

3. A pole with a zero real part ($\text{Re}(p_i) = 0$) characterizes a steady component of the solution.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

Poles with an imaginary component ($\text{Im}(p_i) \neq 0$) generate oscillatory behavior. Such poles necessarily come in conjugate pairs (so that their product is real).

**Part 2**. Transfer function poles
1. You can change the transfer function by adjusting the number and location of the poles and zeros. Set the number of poles to two and change the location of the poles to $p = -1, -2$. The transfer function should be $F(s) = 1/[(s+1)(s+2)]$. Is the system stable or unstable?
2. Adjust the number of poles and their locations to reproduce the transfer functions shown below.

   a. $F(s) = \frac{1}{s^2 + 1}$
   b. $F(s) = \frac{1}{(s-1)(s^2+2s+2)}$
   c.  $F(s) = \frac{1}{(s-1)(s+2)(s^2+4s+8)}$
3.  Which of the transfer functions are stable? Which are unstable?

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

**Part 3**. Single pole system responses

1. Change the number of poles (/pole pairs) to 1. Also, adjust the stop time of the response simulation to ~20 seconds using the slider.
2. Adjust the position of the pole (or pole pair, when the pole is complex) to produce graphs similar to the various impulse responses shown below.

(hw3-exercise-1)=
#### Homework Exercise 1

![exercise](images/write.png)

You can write the DC motor angular velocity transfer function as

$$\frac{\Omega}{V} = \frac{g}{ s^2 + bs + c}$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

##### Homework Exercise 1(a)

Suppose that a DC motor has constants $g =60$, $b = 2.3$, and $c = 11$. Define the transfer function in MATLAB using the [`tf`](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/tf.html) function.

```{code-cell}
---
slideshow:
  slide_type: subslide
---
% Write your code here
g = 60; b = 2.3; c = 11;
G = tf([0 0 g],[1 b c])
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}


##### Homework Exercise 1(b)

Is the system stable? You can plot the poles in the s-plane using the [`pzmap`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/lti.pzmap.html) function. For example, to plot the poles of a transfer function G, use:

```

```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}


##### Homework Exercise 1(c)
What are the poles of the transfer function? You can use the [`pole`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/lti.pole.html) function to compute the poles of a dynamic system in MATLAB. For example, to identify the poles of a transfer function R, use:

pole(R)
```

```{code-cell}

```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

##### Reflect.

![reflect](images/reflect.png)

* What response would you expect for a brief (impulse) applied voltage in a physical DC motor?
* Based on the poles identified in this exercise, what impulse response do you expect?
* Does the behavior suggested by the poles match your intuition for a physical DC motor? Does the pole analysis suggest any unexpected behaviors?

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

### Natural frequency
The locations of the poles in the s-plane determine the natural oscillation frequencies present in the system.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

* The natural (undamped) frequency (in rad/s) contributed by a pole $p$ is the pole magnitude, $r = |p|$.
* The phase, $\phi = \arg p$, determines the relative strength of the oscillatory component.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

![](images/complexPhaseMag.png)
Phase $\phi$ and magnitude $r$ of pole $p$ shown in the complex plane

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

#### Activity 2

![activity](images/activity.png)

In this activity you will explore how poles relate to the natural frequency response.

Consider the transfer function:

$$H(s) = \frac{1}{s^2 -2\,\mathrm{cos}\left(\phi \right)\,r\,s+r^2},$$

which is constructed with poles: $p = r(\cos \phi \pm i\sin \phi)$.
1. The transfer function poles are plotted below. Change the slider values to $(r,\phi) = (1,135^\circ)$. Are oscillations present in the impulse response?
2. Set $(r,\phi) = (1,100^\circ)$ and then $(r,\phi) = (1,90^\circ)$. Does the frequency of the oscillation change? Are the oscillations more prominent?
3. Set $(r,\phi) = (1.5,90^\circ)$ and then $(r,\phi) = (2,90^\circ)$. Does the frequency of the oscillation change? Are the oscillations more prominent?

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

The activity needs to be done in the MATLAB LiveScript `PoleZeroAnalysis.mlx`

```{code-cell}
---
slideshow:
  slide_type: fragment
---
open('PoleZeroAnalysis.mlx')
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

#### Reflect

![reflect](images/reflect.png)

* Does the conjugate pole $p = r(\cos \phi - i\sin \phi)$ contribute a different natural frequency than the first pole $p = r(\cos \phi + i\sin \phi)$? Why or why not?
* As $r$ increases, does the frequency increase or decrease?
* As $\phi$ approaches $180^\circ$, does the oscillation become more or less prominent?

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

#### Exercise 2

A specific example of the DC motor angular velocity transfer function is
```matlab
G = tf([0 0 60],[1 2.3 11])
```
##### Exercise 2(a)

Compute the poles of the system and then use the poles to compute the system's natural frequencies in rad/s.

```{code-cell}
---
slideshow:
  slide_type: subslide
---
% Write your code here
G = tf([0 0 60],[1 2.3 11])
p = pole(G)
wn = abs(p) % rad/s
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}


##### Exercise 2(b)

You can also use the `damp` function to analyze the natural frequencies of the system. Validate your solution in (a) by calling the `damp` function.

```{code-cell}
---
slideshow:
  slide_type: subslide
---
% Write your code here
damp(G)
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

##### Reflect

![reflect](images/reflect.png)


* What physical interactions cause the oscillatory behavior in the DC motor system?
* The `damp` function offers an additional output: damping. What does this value represent?

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Analysis of a second-order system

Second-order systems with a pair of conjugate poles and no zeros are useful for illustrating the natural frequency response analytically. It is helpful to write this type of system in the form:

$$G(s) = \frac{ K }{s^2 + 2 \zeta \omega_n s  + \omega_n^2}$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

where
* $K$ is the gain coefficient
* $\zeta$ is the damping ratio
*  and $\omega_n$ is the (undamped) natural frequency.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

These parameters are helpful for drawing a connection between the natural response of the system and the properties of the poles. In this section, the poles of the second-order system will be analytically computed and related to the natural response of the system.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

#### Pole analysis
The poles of the system occur when the denominator is zero:

$$p = - \zeta \omega_n \pm \omega_n \sqrt{\zeta^2 - 1 }$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

For simplicity, consider $\zeta \in [0,1)$. In this case, the poles are

$$p = - \zeta \omega_n \pm j \omega_n \sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

As stated above, the natural frequency is defined as the magnitude of the pole. The magnitude is computed as $\sqrt{ Re^2 + Im^2}$:

\begin{array}{rl} |p|  &= \sqrt{ (-\zeta \omega_n)^2 + ( \pm \omega_n \sqrt{1-\zeta^2})^2 } \\   &= \sqrt{ \zeta^2 \omega_n^2 + \omega_n^2 (1-\zeta^2) } \\   &= |\omega_n|\
\end{array}

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

##### Natural frequency $\omega_n$

This illustrates why this form of the equation is used: the natural frequency is the parameter $\omega_n$.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

##### Damping ratio $\zeta$

The damping ratio $\zeta$ determines the relative strength of the exponential part of the response.

As $\zeta \rightarrow 1$, the complex part of the pole tends to zero, implying less oscillatory and stronger exponential behavior.

For stable systems, that implies greater damping.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

##### Gain coefficient $K$

The gain coefficient $K$ affects the magnitude of the response, not the time-dependent behavior.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

#### Natural response
The impulse response is also called the *natural response*. The natural response $x(t)$ is computed by taking the inverse Laplace transform of

$$\frac{X(s)}{U(s)} = \frac{X(s)}{1} = \frac{ K }{s^2 + 2 \zeta \omega_n s  + \omega_n^2}$$

because the impulse $u(t) = \delta(t)$ has a Laplace transform $U(s) = 1$. You can find the response's analytic form by referring to a table or using the [`ilaplace`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/sym.ilaplace.html) function.

```{code-cell}
---
slideshow:
  slide_type: subslide
---
syms s zeta omega_n K X(s) x(t)
X(s) = K/(s^2 + 2*zeta*omega_n*s + omega_n^2)
x(t) = ilaplace(X) % The impulse response in the time domain
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

Notice that the impulse response is a product of an exponential and sine function. From these functions observe that:
* The sine function frequency (in rads/s) is $\omega_n \sqrt{1-\zeta^2}$. If the damping $\zeta = 0$, then the frequency is $\omega_n$. This is the reason $\omega_n$ is often referred to as the undamped natural frequency.
* The rate of decay of the exponential damping function is $\omega_n \zeta$.
* The gain parameter $K$ only contributes as a constant multiplier to the magnitude of the response.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

##### Activity 3

![activity](images/activity.png)

Open the MATLAB LiveScript `PoleZeroAnalysis.mlx` and find this activity there. Adjust the sliders to view different time-domain responses for the classical second-order system:

$$G(s) = \frac{ K }{s^2 + 2 \zeta \omega_n s  + \omega_n^2}$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

##### Reflect.
* Does the carrier frequency of the solution change with the damping coefficient $\zeta$?
* Does the exponential envelope change with $\omega_n$?
* How does the gain $K$ affect the response?

##### Reflect
* The transient of the step response that exceeds the steady value (y = 1, in this case) is known as the overshoot. As the zero moves further in the negative direction along the real axis, what happens to the overshoot?
* The time it takes to reach the steady value (y = 1, in this case) is known as the rise time. How is the rise time affected by changes to the zero, z_0?
* Try other values of the poles and zero, do you observe similar changes to the overshoot and rise time?

### Homework Exercise 3 : Transfer Function with a Single Zero

![homework](images/write.png)

In this exercise, you will examine the changes to the analytic step response of a transfer function with a single zero.

Consider the transfer function used in the previous activity:

$$G = \frac{s-z_0}{s^2 + 2s + 2}$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

#### Homework Exercise 3(a)

Compute the symbolic form of the step response of the transfer function, $x(t$). You can perform the analytic computations by hand or using the Symbolic Math Toolbox.

```{code-cell}
---
slideshow:
  slide_type: subslide
---
% Use these symbolic variables
syms s z_0 t positive
% Write your solution here
x = NaN
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

#### Homework Exercise 3(b)

Plot the analytic step response with $z_0 = -1$ on the interval $t \in [0, 10]$. If you computed the step response function with the Symbolic Math Toolbox, you can use the [`matlabFunction`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/matlabfunction.html) command to convert it to a function handle that you can evaluate.

```{code-cell}

  slide_type: subslide

% Create your plot here
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}


#### Homework Exercise 3(c)
Using the analytic form of the transfer function, compute the limit of the function as $t \to \infty$.

```{code-cell}
---
slideshow:
  slide_type: subslide
---
% Write your solution here
tlim = NaN
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

##### Reflect.

![reflect](images/reflect.png)

* Vary the location of the zero ($z_0$) and observe how the step response changes.
* How does the location of the zero ($z_0$) affect the overall magnitude of the step response? Where does this show up in the analytic solution?
* How does the location of the zero ($z_0$) affect the rise time and overshoot? Where does this show up in the analytic solution?
