    "## About the Laplace Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Laplace Transformation (named after [Pierre-Simon Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace)) is a useful mathematical tool that is used in many branches of engineering including signals and systems theory, control theory, communications, mechanical engineering, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its principle benefits are: \n",
    "\n",
    "* it enables us to represent differential equations that model the behaviour of systems in the time domain as polynomials in $s$ which facilitates their solution\n",
    "\n",
    "* it converts time convolution (which is how we determine the time-response of a system to a given signal) into a simple multiplication in the $s$ domain\n",
    "\n",
    "* it allows us to model linear time-invariant (LTI) system components using transfer functions and systems by block diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "* block diagram analysis allows us to readily compute system responses to complex signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only downside is that time $t$ is a real value whereas the Laplace transformation operator $s$ is a complex exponential $s = \\sigma + j\\omega$.\n",
