00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:11,040
Hi, this is Chris Jobling. I'm the instructor on EG-247 signals and systems.

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:24,330
And this is the first of what I'm calling pre-lectures in a flipped learning model for this course, signals on systems.

3
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:34,800
And what I want to do in this session is to introduce the idea of signals and systems and to go over one or two things in advance of the first class,

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:43,080
which will be holding on Monday, the 24th of January.

5
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,650
For this presentation, I'm using a tool called Jupyter Notebooks.

6
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,270
It's a sort of presentation tool in this mode.

7
00:00:50,270 --> 00:01:13,890
And but it's also the basis of the course notes for this module, which I will flip over onto another browser and bring up for you.

8
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:32,990
So if you go to the Internet, to this web site that is linked into the course, you will find that these.

9
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:39,680
These are the notes. So I'm actually working through this chapter of the notes, the first page.

10
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,010
But I'm doing it in slide show mode for the benefit of this presentation. But you obviously can read the full thing later.

11
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:52,550
And they're linked into the canvas site for the module.

12
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:59,480
So as I said, I'm going to make a short presentation and I will do this for each of the lectures.

13
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:11,960
So when you go to Canvas, you will find there will be a video, Panopto video that you'll be able to annotate as you watch this back.

14
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:18,080
And hopefully this will set the scene for what we'll do in the active classrooms,

15
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,590
which are intended to be more sort of examples, classes, guided activities.

16
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,100
But it's very important that when you come to those classes that you have gone through

17
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:35,540
tthese videos perhaps answered the quiz if there is one for this particular video.

18
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,720
I don't think there is. But there are certain things, you need to do before coming.

19
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,540
For example, skim reading the notes, making notes yourself.

20
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,160
And then when you come to class, we will have activities which will help you to practise the material.

21
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:58,730
So this has flipped learning approach. And the idea is that instead of using our precious time together just to deliver a lecture.

22
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:06,410
What I'll do is I'll record, pre-record the lectures. They'll tend to be shorter than a typical lecture would be.

23
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:16,160
And you will then be able to watch those in advance, come along, prepared to take part in class.

24
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:26,490
So let us begin. So as it says there, you can get these notes in various forms.

25
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:32,210
There's going to be a version of it distributed as worksheet one, which

26
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:40,950
We will work through in the class on Monday. You can find this source code for this page here.

27
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:46,530
Obviously, this is a Web site. So this is referring to the actual notes.

28
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,000
You can view them as HTML

29
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:05,060
Or as PDF. This actual session is based upon the first chapter of a book called Signals and Systems for Dummies.

30
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:11,280
And don't laugh. This actually turns out to be quite a useful book.

31
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,050
And it's a very useful introduction of these to the topics that we are going to be covering in this module

32
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:32,790
And we've got it in the reading list as a recommended text. If I click on there, I should get to the reading list to show you.

33
00:04:32,790 --> 00:05:14,100
Hopefully the link is correct. It is very slow this morning.

34
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:46,700
This should have been a link directly to it, so I will have to correct that afterwards.

35
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:52,210
OK, so this is a reading list. Let me get that link.

36
00:05:52,210 --> 00:06:05,370
Bring it into the notes so it's

37
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,890
correct next time. So it's in the reading list

38
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:14,160
as you can see. And it's one of the texts that is recommended.

39
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,150
[the] reason it's in the list is because you can actually access the book from the library.

40
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:32,310
So if you click on that link, you can follow it through to the actual library available ability and is available, I believe, a book from the library.

41
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,950
But this particular chapter that I am using is also available as a downloadable PDF.

42
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:43,510
So if you click on that link, it will take you to.

43
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:52,890
This page. Which is the signal system that you can and can download chapter one and the table of contents with this list.

44
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:58,200
So Chapter one is what I base these notes on.

45
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:07,710
So it's if you go to Canvas, you'll see that Chapter one is linked to the notes for this particular pre-lecture.

46
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,600
And you should read it beforehand if you can.

47
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,610
In this particular session, though, we're going to cover these topics.

48
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:25,290
So we're going to introduce you to what may be some revision for you: the idea of continuous-time signals, continuous-time systems.

49
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:31,680
And then we'll look at discrete-time signals discrete-time systems, signal classifications, domains for signals.

50
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:43,450
and I will say a little bit about systems thinking and system design, but mostly we will point you to the textbook for definitions of those things.

51
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:47,140
So let's begin by looking at continuous time signals.

52
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:57,250
These are probably the signals that are the most familiar to you. They represent what we can hear in the world about us.

53
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:06,370
And basically, the continuous-time signal is represented mathematically by functions which vary continuously with time.

54
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:19,630
So, here's an example of a sinusoidal signal, for example, that signals that you get out of your power supply as AC voltages.

55
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,990
They are pretty fundamental, as you can imagine in electrical engineering,

56
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:31,780
particularly in the power distribution field and for driving machines like motors and so on.

57
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,980
The mathematical model of a sinusoidal signal is given by this expression.

58
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:51,610
Shown on the slide here, so x of t is equal to A times the cosine of two pi f zero times t minus phi, which is an angle in radians.

59
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:56,770
So what does that mean physically?

60
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:06,310
So what we will do in class is we will get you to think about what each of those symbols represents.

61
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:13,780
And we will basically look to to fill in this table.

62
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:18,460
The symbols here are not in the right order and you may may have noticed.

63
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:23,230
So the idea is to match symbols to the correct signal.

64
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:28,300
But let's see if we can get some insight using some mathematics.

65
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:37,960
So all of the key features of this particular module is going to be that we are going to emphasise the use of computational tools wherever possible.

66
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,990
So we're going to take a very engineering or pragmatic approach.

67
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:46,660
We are not going to go deeply into the mathematics, although there will be some mathematical analysis to do.

68
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:52,150
But we will exploit the tools when we can.

69
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,670
And one of the things we want to do.

70
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:03,070
And one of the tools that I'm going to recommend we use, first of all, is a tool that's available on the Internet called Wolfram Alpha.

71
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,530
You may already have used it, and then we're going to see the same exercise done in the tool.

72
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:16,990
We're gonna be using mostly on this course, which is MATLAB. So let's redefine the problem in the form that we can do some computation on.

73
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:22,630
OK. So we'll we'll replace the symbols by numerical values.

74
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:27,850
So we're now going to look at this particular instance of that previous general equation,

75
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:36,460
which is three cos, two pi times, two t minus three pi over four.

76
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:48,370
And you'll notice that the angle that we use in mathematics is defined in radians rather than degrees.

77
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,870
So there's a link in this slides which will take us to Wolfram Alpha dot com.

78
00:10:51,870 --> 00:11:00,460
I've already got the window open, so I'm just going to copy this text and I'm going to paste it into the box over here in Wolfram Alpha.

79
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:32,720
And let's see what it tells us about this particular expression.

80
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,100
OK, so it's gone away. Thought about it. Come back with some information, it's telling me what it thinks it is.

81
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:46,410
And what I'm asking to do is plot, which is a good guess. And so it's given me two plots.

82
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:54,960
You can see this useful cursor on this. You can see that there is a, it's certainly a sine wave.

83
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:02,170
It starts over here. Zero time at minus two.

84
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:07,390
And then it moves up to three and down to [minus[ three.

85
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,980
And then there's a period here of about what will it be.

86
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:21,070
Uh. Right.

87
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:27,050
Simpson, some five. OK, so that's that's a plot in itself.

88
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,360
Give me a larger, slightly larger one with a few more things. And of course, you can reason about that.

89
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,980
So that's that's a useful visualisation of it.

90
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:42,040
It tells us a few things, I think, straight away. For example, the amplitude you case measure the phase, the phase,

91
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:50,380
which is how this differs from zero at zero time, because obviously this would be a cosine signal.

92
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:59,710
So it would start at, normally start at one or rather at the peak here and then

93
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:07,190
so it's obviously been shifted by some some angle - the face shift.

94
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:12,060
Okay, so that might give us a clue now so we can say first things.

95
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:18,970
So let's do that again in Matlab, which is the tool we're going to mainly use in this course.

96
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:24,550
We need to break it down a little bit. It's not quite as straightforward as Wolfram Alpha.

97
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,840
The first thing I need to do is to set things up. So don't worry about these commands.

98
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:34,120
You wouldn't normally use these commands yourself. I just need to use them in this Jupyter notebook.

99
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,440
So the first thing we do is define the time.

100
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,670
And we're doing that as a linear set of values from zero to one.

101
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:49,260
So we want 100 values in the range of zero to one.

102
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:57,070
We're going to define x. Which, of course, is the expression that we had previously.

103
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:03,040
But we have to write it out, uh, more precisely now or in a form that the computer can understand.

104
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:10,050
So we we need the multiplication signs '*', for example, to represent multiplication.

105
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,350
And we have to use those.

106
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:19,010
Whereas for the previous example, for Wolfram Alpha, example, we could be,

107
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:28,800
as you can see, very you think that some more mathematical form that we are more used to writing, or seeing in textbooks and so on.

108
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:37,340
So notice no explicit multiplication in that expression, but we need to put it in MATLAB so we'll do that.

109
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:45,970
So let me define my cosine waveform.

110
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:51,240
And then we're going to plot it. So in MATLAB, it's always nice to, when you plot.

111
00:14:51,240 --> 00:15:04,150
Plot is easy. You just plot T against X, but, or  X against T is also very useful to add in the values of the sine wave.

112
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:21,020
So let us do at. We should get a plot in a few minutes appearing on the screen.

113
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:30,450
OK, so after a few seconds, the plot comes up and you can you can see a similar sort of process every zero time.

114
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:39,360
You can see there is a definite face shift because a zero time we'd expect this to be a peak for cosine wave, but it's not.

115
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:47,040
So it's been shifted forward in time or back in time, really, by this amount.

116
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,050
Just on the point, just a little point, five point six, seven, something like that.

117
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:58,110
And then the wave form is. It's more than that, isn't it?

118
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:05,550
Because this is a peak. So and then the waveform goes down and the height is three. In MATLAB

119
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:24,520
You can also. Put things into scripts.

120
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:33,060
So here I am. And running a script to edit the sine wave function.

121
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:42,600
And hopefully that's coming up in this window here, so you can see I define that as a script here called sinewave.m

122
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:50,080
And I can run that script. By just typing sinewave.

123
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,250
So returning to the question we started with before we did a bit of analysis.

124
00:16:54,250 --> 00:17:00,360
What do these symbols mean? Do we think? So clearly

125
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:12,170
Um, the thing that was causing the phase was perhaps this phi. This value here was somehow related to the period.

126
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:21,040
And this is clearly amplitude. So we'll talk more about that in the in the class.

127
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:32,770
So what's the period of that waveform in seconds? That's something you might think about before you come to that class.

128
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:38,320
So that was a continuous time signal, um

129
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,450
Of course, the thing we want to do with those is we want to process those signals in some way.

130
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:52,750
And we have continuous-time systems to do that. So a system, in very general terms is just an operator H.

131
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,710
That maps an input signal X to an output signal Y.

132
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:01,300
So we could call it y(t) is H

133
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:07,930
operated on x(t). We will say more about what that H is in a little bit.

134
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:14,680
But here's an example. Let's say we have an electronic amplifier with a gain of five and a level shift at two.

135
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:21,090
Then we would define that as 5 x(t) + 2

136
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:28,160
and we can have a block diagram for that in Simulink, and we'll show you this running actually in class.

137
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:35,964
Will actually bring it up and show you it running and the signals you can get.

138
00:18:35,964 --> 00:18:40,704
The other kind of signals we deal with in this course are discrete-time signals a very important class of signals,

139
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:49,644
particularly in the modern era where we're using computation for a lot of signal processing these days. For a discrete-time signal.

140
00:18:49,644 --> 00:18:53,754
We don't use time. So time is implicit.

141
00:18:53,754 --> 00:18:59,614
Instead, we use an index n. So a discrete- time signal is x(n).

142
00:18:59,614 --> 00:19:08,004
And notice the square brackets rather than the round brackets to differentiate between continuous-time and discrete-time.

143
00:19:08,004 --> 00:19:13,074
So a discrete-time signal is only defined at those interview values of n.

144
00:19:13,074 --> 00:19:20,454
And there are only actual signal at specific instants of time.

145
00:19:20,454 --> 00:19:26,604
One advantage of discrete-time signals is that it can be stored in computer memory and operated on after the fact.

146
00:19:26,604 --> 00:19:34,334
For example, MP3 players, you record some music, encode it as MP3, distribute it across the Internet,

147
00:19:34,334 --> 00:19:41,994
and then someone plays it back, and you reconstruct the signal from the data that you've recorded.

148
00:19:41,994 --> 00:19:50,724
So here's an example of that. We've got a single response, let's say y[n] = 5, if is less than 10 or zero.

149
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:55,494
otherwise. We can plot that, visualise that as a stem plot.

150
00:19:55,494 --> 00:20:04,094
So we defined the function, saved it as something called y.m and we we're going to just run that function.

151
00:20:04,094 --> 00:20:09,764
So we're going to define a set of values for n let's say, minus 15 to 18.

152
00:20:09,764 --> 00:20:17,744
We are going to make some space for the signal. So it's the same size as n.

153
00:20:17,744 --> 00:20:25,854
And then we're just going to compute that signal by using a for-loop.

154
00:20:25,854 --> 00:20:30,604
Because you don't need a for-loop actually, you can just say y(n)

155
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:42,244
Anyway. We then plot the results, and for this we use a stem plot, because these are discrete values, they're not a continuous signal.

156
00:20:42,244 --> 00:20:46,234
I'll show you that it looks like now.

157
00:20:46,234 --> 00:20:56,194
So stem plots is is not going to be a continuous signal it's is going to have a set of values indicating where the value is defined and where it's not.

158
00:20:56,194 --> 00:21:01,294
And you can see these are where the signal is zero. This is where the signal is zero.

159
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:09,214
And this is a bit where the signal has got a value of five. And this indicates that these are not continuous.

160
00:21:09,214 --> 00:21:16,114
These are discrete values of the sample signal.

161
00:21:16,114 --> 00:21:25,234
Of course, you can then have a discrete-time system, which, again, using a similar notation, maps a sequence to another sequence.

162
00:21:25,234 --> 00:21:30,004
So here is an example of one of those. This is called a two tap filter.

163
00:21:30,004 --> 00:21:32,974
So here we have, it a sort of a moving average thing.

164
00:21:32,974 --> 00:21:43,324
We have three-quarters of x[n]: the current value of the sequence and then a quarter of X of the previous value and gives us Y.

165
00:21:43,324 --> 00:21:56,664
So again, we can model that in Simulink. And we have the values three-quarters, another quarter when it was that represents x[n-1]

166
00:21:56,664 --> 00:22:05,674
a one-sample delay. This is a straightforward [???] thing. Two taps because we've got the signal being split into two parts.

167
00:22:05,674 --> 00:22:18,564
And then recombined at the end. And again, in the class, we will show you this, demonstrate this particular model with some real data.

168
00:22:18,564 --> 00:22:27,714
So what else have we got? Other classifications. On of the most important ones is periodic signals, signals that repeat over and over again.

169
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:33,864
They are said to be periodic. We define them as x(t + T) is equal x(t).

170
00:22:33,864 --> 00:22:41,484
So if there is repetition so that some T times later the signal is the same as it was for for t

171
00:22:41,484 --> 00:22:47,154
then we have a periodic signal. For discrete signals.

172
00:22:47,154 --> 00:22:54,474
Again, that's discrete signal. Is periodic if it repeats itself after some N samples.

173
00:22:54,474 --> 00:23:05,764
So the smallest value of T or N for which standard quality is true is called the signal period.

174
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:13,174
Here is a square wave to the periodic signal, obviously plotted it.

175
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:31,584
So let's move on and plot. You can see the periodic signal getting a square wave.

176
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:38,324
Another class of signals which are important on what are called aperiodic signals.

177
00:23:38,324 --> 00:23:44,654
So they're not periodic. They don't repeat themselves.

178
00:23:44,654 --> 00:23:52,434
It does matter what the point of view is, because the signal may be periodic but the period may be very large, so it can still

179
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:56,474
be considered to be aperiodic. So here is

180
00:23:56,474 --> 00:24:05,774
Let's define an example. This is a rectangular pulse. So it exists only for a short period of time.

181
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:28,214
And again, we can plot it. And there you can see we have a pulse.

182
00:24:28,214 --> 00:24:34,944
And then it disappears. And we assume this never comes back.

183
00:24:34,944 --> 00:24:44,154
Signals can also be random. This is quite useful. A kind of signal to represent noise wether

184
00:24:44,154 --> 00:24:48,784
added or inherent in the system.

185
00:24:48,784 --> 00:24:54,094
So let's just plot a random signal and you can see that's sort of typical of a random signal.

186
00:24:54,094 --> 00:24:57,964
It looks like it's very noisy.

187
00:24:57,964 --> 00:25:06,184
So this thing you might see on a scope if you haven't connected to ground, and these signals are often used for various reasons,

188
00:25:06,184 --> 00:25:13,564
for example, to identify a system transfer function from from a signal or for

189
00:25:13,564 --> 00:25:32,324
other things. We will be talking a lot in this course about domains. If we go to the Canvas sites for this module.

190
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:42,864
This is a sort of picture of the domains that we'll be dealing with. So we've got time domain, complex frequency domain, frequency domain, z domain.

191
00:25:42,864 --> 00:25:49,534
And you've got sample data. You've got sample frequency. And we've got discrete Fourier transform.

192
00:25:49,534 --> 00:25:52,874
And there are a few other links that I've missed off this picture.

193
00:25:52,874 --> 00:25:58,814
For example, there is a connexion between time and frequency through the Fourier transform.

194
00:25:58,814 --> 00:26:04,694
You can go from time (t) to n by sampling and you can go back and forth here.

195
00:26:04,694 --> 00:26:11,104
So those those links will be added as we go along. Maybe update this picture at some point.

196
00:26:11,104 --> 00:26:18,504
Those are the domains that we'll be dealing with in this course. So that's what we mean by a domain.

197
00:26:18,504 --> 00:26:23,414
And we often need to go from one to the other, for example, from time to

198
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:28,274
complex frequency or times to frequency. So these are the domains that we can be looking at.

199
00:26:28,274 --> 00:26:37,724
Going to be looking at the frequency domain. f of omega, the Laplace transform, s domain, where s is a complex variable.

200
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:40,964
Omega is an imaginary variable.

201
00:26:40,964 --> 00:26:52,634
Similarly, for discrete-time systems, we might go from discrete time domain n to frequency remain omega hat or the Z domain Z.

202
00:26:52,634 --> 00:26:57,614
So these are the sort of things well be doing. For example, the frequency domain.

203
00:26:57,614 --> 00:27:04,514
Let's consider we've got 2 sinusoids that we want to add together.

204
00:27:04,514 --> 00:27:13,304
I've got a function that defines that so let's just run it in this in the interests of time.

205
00:27:13,304 --> 00:27:22,494
This is going to run that formula and plot the result.

206
00:27:22,494 --> 00:27:31,504
And they could see the two sides signals when they added together, you get this bumpy signal, which doesn't look very much like a sine wave.

207
00:27:31,504 --> 00:27:35,284
You can see it's periodic, but it doesn't look much like a sine wave.

208
00:27:35,284 --> 00:27:45,874
But if we look at the frequencies in this sine wave by doing a frequency spectrum, putting it through a fast Fourier transfer on an oscilloscope

209
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:57,184
for example, then we get two distinct frequencies and we can see how relatively big they are by the size of these peaks.

210
00:27:57,184 --> 00:28:03,394
And we can see where they are by where they are on the frequency axis. So we see that this one is clearly one Hz.

211
00:28:03,394 --> 00:28:09,064
And this is clearly two point two Hz.

212
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:15,804
So this is quite useful way of looking at complex signals like this.

213
00:28:15,804 --> 00:28:19,684
They are often built up of frequencies and we can look at those frequencies,

214
00:28:19,684 --> 00:28:27,694
pick out what's going on, how much energy is in there in the signal, for example, how much bandwidth we need to transmit it.

215
00:28:27,694 --> 00:28:37,024
So frequency response or frequency analysis is a very useful way of looking at complex periodic signals.

216
00:28:37,024 --> 00:28:39,624
The other thing we can do is a Fourier transform.

217
00:28:39,624 --> 00:28:49,494
So if you have aperiodic signals, we can go from the time domain to the frequency domain and we can use the inverse Fourier transform to go back.

218
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:53,884
And we'll have a couple of lectures on that particular issue.

219
00:28:53,884 --> 00:29:00,694
We've also got the Laplace and Z-transform domains which are complex frequencies,

220
00:29:00,694 --> 00:29:07,054
quite useful for solving differential equations, for example, or for control theory.

221
00:29:07,054 --> 00:29:11,654
We have then this variable s, which has a real and imaginary part.

222
00:29:11,654 --> 00:29:18,094
And we could describe a location in the s-plane using an imaginary number.

223
00:29:18,094 --> 00:29:24,314
And by using s domain, we can actually easily solve differential equations.

224
00:29:24,314 --> 00:29:33,004
And we come up with the idea of a transfer function. For discrete-time signals there is an equivalent operator called Z,

225
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:42,244
which does something similar to sequences. The last thing I just wanted to mention, systems thinking and systems design.

226
00:29:42,244 --> 00:29:53,164
This is basically, just to point you to the relevant part, part of the handout for the, not the handout,

227
00:29:53,164 --> 00:29:59,914
but the first chapter of Signals and Systems for Dummies might be worth reading because this is sort of

228
00:29:59,914 --> 00:30:05,254
the approach we are going to be taking : we are going to think in terms of behavioural model.

229
00:30:05,254 --> 00:30:12,124
We're gonna rely on abstraction through mathematics. We're going to work top down to solve problems.

230
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:20,164
We're gonna be using mathematics and mathematical software. The reason I'm not using the signals and systems for dummies is the main text for

231
00:30:20,164 --> 00:30:26,914
this course is only because the examples given are all using programming language.

232
00:30:26,914 --> 00:30:31,654
Python and I wanted to use programming language MATLAB.

233
00:30:31,654 --> 00:30:34,324
So Matlab is is the basis of this course.

234
00:30:34,324 --> 00:30:46,684
And so I've got a textbook called Karris which will introduce you to next session, which is the book that will be used in this course.

235
00:30:46,684 --> 00:30:54,804
So other things to look at, familiar signals or systems or some questions on this that you might want to approach later.

236
00:30:54,804 --> 00:31:05,364
Again, some examples of of systems that will be familiar, for example, the mobile phone and what signals are in that. You may want to have a look at that.

237
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:11,704
And we'll talk about that perhaps in the first class. So thank you for watching.

238
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:22,714
Sorry that some of the computation was slow. I'm going to have to make sure that I got everything turned off on my Mac when I go into the classes.

239
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:28,054
But we have now covered everything we need for this particular introduction to the class.

240
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:37,874
I'll go away and edit the video, tidy. ir up a bit and then I'll see you on the 24th of January.

241
00:31:37,874 --> 00:31:58,374
12:00 p.m., I think it is, in Y Twyni 002. You can find the link to the lecture in Canvas if you go to the calendar.

242
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:03,154
On the 24th, there it is, integration into the entry, the class.

243
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:18,794
And the other thing to note is that the notes for this particular session.

244
00:32:18,794 --> 00:32:25,724
Really, really slow. Sorry about this. This is not the way it should should be.

245
00:32:25,724 --> 00:32:48,684
If you go to modules. All the preparation, preparatory reading, etc. for this particular class, you will find starting on this page here.

246
00:32:48,684 --> 00:32:56,094
The next class on [also on Monday] will be about elementary signals, and I'll make a video for that in a couple of minutes.

247
00:32:56,094 --> 00:33:03,941
Thanks very much for watching. I will see you soon.
