00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:10,910
Hi, this is Chris Jobling, and this is the second of week one's pre-lectures. And this one is on elementary signals.

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:21,720
If you're interested, you can find the detailed notes for this in Chapter one of textbook Karris [2012].

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:31,840
And you will be able to just read a little bit more about the detailed mathematical details, should you be interested?

4
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,800
What I'm going to do in this pre-lecture is to talk about what we mean by elementary

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,730
signals and particularly those signals which can be applied to electrical circuits.

6
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,320
We're going to introduce to the unit step ,unit ramp, and the Dirac delta function.

7
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,870
We're going to talk about the sampling and sifting properties of the Delta function,

8
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,740
and we'll conclude with some examples of how useful signals can be synthesised from these elementary signals.

9
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:07,750
And we will probably do that last bullet point in the class.

10
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,600
So let's begin by just doing a little bit of a thought experiment.

11
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,370
So let's imagine you've got this circuit, a simple circuit with a voltage supply, a resistor R

12
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:28,960
and a switch and the output across those two terminals illustrated on this picture here.

13
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,230
So what happens when we close the switch?

14
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:42,780
Is there a way of expressing that mathematically and drawing the appropriate waveforn representing the behaviour of that circuit?

15
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,010
So the switch is closed at some time t = T.

16
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:56,770
And what will happen then? Well, clearly, when the switch is closed, the voltage here will will appear

17
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,290
Vs will appear on the output here. Before the switch is closed

18
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,700
there'll be nothing on the output: it is zero volts there.

19
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,930
So what happens at the time of the switch?

20
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:17,190
That's really the important point. So before the switch is closed, we're going to have an output voltage of zero.

21
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,560
And after the switch is closed, we're going to have a voltage of Vs.

22
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,540
And the interesting thing is what happens at the moment that the switch is closed. Instantly closed.

23
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,670
Well, physically, there can't be a very quick change.

24
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:45,600
But mathematically, we can assume that the voltage is going to jump instantaneously from zero to Vs volts at time t. Physically,

25
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,440
in reality, this this won't be correct. There'll be some slope here.

26
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,830
But this is a useful mathematical model of the ideal case.

27
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,410
And we call this kind of signal a "step function" for obvious reasons.

28
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:14,940
It looks like a step. So the step function is defined as U_0(t) (or U zero of t) and is equal to zero for t less than 0 and 1 for t greater.

29
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,450
Than naught. But notice it's not defined up.

30
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:27,860
t equals naught. In Matlab, we have a function called the Heaviside function,

31
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:35,700
and this function is named after this chap Oliver Heaviside who came up with it in his studies.

32
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:44,570
So I'll let you read about Mr. Heaviside. If you're interested. Electrical engineer.

33
00:03:44,570 --> 00:04:06,990
So we have a function named after him in Matlab called  the Heaviside function.

34
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:13,730
So let's, so let's have a look at the Heaviside

35
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:24,520
function. So this is what it looks like. To use this

36
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,500
we need to be using a feature of MATLAB called the symbolic maths tool box.

37
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,260
And this is introduced in this code here by this expression "sims t"

38
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,340
So we're defining t to be a symbol as opposed to a number.

39
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:47,260
And then we're gonna plotted using this function ezplot, plotting Heaviside of T from minus one to one.

40
00:04:47,260 --> 00:05:01,110
And then we're also going to compute the Heaviside of zero. OK, so that's what it looks like,

41
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:10,230
it looks like a square wave and the Heaviside of zero is given the value of 0.5 or halfway between one and zero.

42
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:22,670
This is not actually mathematically correct. IBut it's a useful value if you need to plot it.

43
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:29,740
So once you've established a function, then we can do various things to it.

44
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:35,820
So, for example. We can scale a function by a positive number or negative number.

45
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:44,800
And we'll do these actually, in class but here is an example.

46
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,220
OK, so we define A  to be two. So we can plot it and then we have a plot.

47
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,770
You can see that the function goes from zero to two at time equals naught.

48
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:04,430
We've also added a bit of, as is usual, we've added some axes to the to the plot.

49
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:12,520
So let's have a look at the case where A is negative. I can guess, I guess you can guess what happened here.

50
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:22,180
Well, let's just prove it. You can see that now the signal starts at zero and goes down to minus two, a t = 0.

51
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:31,310
So what about if we reverse time? If we sketch u0(t -t), for example, what happens then?

52
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:45,420
Well, again, we can easily plot it. And what we'll see is that the signal is reversed in sense, in that the step happens before time equals zero.

53
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:56,530
And then it goes to zero after time equals zero. What about delays or advances? If we take

54
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:06,330
u0(t - T) for example, or u0(t + T), what happens then?

55
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:13,700
So we will take the first case, u0(t - T)

56
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:22,090
T = 1 in this case, so you can see what happens is that the point of the step is delayed by one second.

57
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:28,120
So it happens one second after zero time for u0(t - T).

58
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:38,110
So what do you think was going to happen if we go u0(t + T)?

59
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:43,350
Hopefully, you've got the right answer.

60
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:50,890
It actually happens earlier or time is advanced so it happens earlier than zero time.

61
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:56,830
So we call this "time advance". We call the previous case "time delay". We will work

62
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,530
some some examples of this in the class using work sheet 3.

63
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:11,020
So the unit step is a very useful function to us.

64
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:18,430
We can use it to synthesise various signals. For example, we can synthesise pulses.

65
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:25,910
Triangle waves and so on. And we'll go through some examples of this in class.

66
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:35,190
Another very useful elementary signal is the ramp function. And this, the simplest way to model this is by the circuit shown on this slide.

67
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:42,380
Well, now we have an open circuit after this, which we actually have a capacitor.

68
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,570
We have a current source. So when the switch is closed, current will flow in the circuit.

69
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:59,090
This capacitor will charge up and it will charge up linearly because there's a constant current.

70
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:05,420
So we can work out what's going to happen here by solving this equation, the capacitor,

71
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:17,730
the voltage across the capacitor is going to be equal to one over the capacitance times the integral from negative infinity to t.

72
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,460
Ic tau with respect to tau

73
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:29,990
Where tau is some kind of dummy variable in this integral. So when the switch closes?

74
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:37,070
The current in the capacitor is going to be equal to current in the source.

75
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,280
Multiplied by a u0(t) or u zero of t because it's a step function.

76
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:53,030
So it switches on at zero time. And then if t < 0, obviously there is no voltage supply and so the integral would be zero.

77
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:59,430
So we can change the limits of the integral from minus infinity to zero for is.

78
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,790
Of course, that's going to be zero. And we have is/C times the integral of one.

79
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:10,490
And of course, the integral of 1 is going to be t

80
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:20,630
So the voltage across the capacitor can be represented then by an expression is/C times t times u0(t)

81
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:28,060
And in this case, the u0(t) is actually acting as a "gating function" as I call it.

82
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:40,360
So let's plot it. This is the expression that we've just done, so it's going to look like this.

83
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,780
See, the signal is flat from zero negative time to zero.

84
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:55,440
And then after the switch is closed. This wraps up at a constant rate effectively until it clips.

85
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,090
But theoretically, at least, it will continue forever like that.

86
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:06,220
And we call this function a ramp function. Or u1(t).

87
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:13,810
So we define it as a show here u1(t) the integral of u0(tau) dtau

88
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:20,890
So it's equal to 0 for t less than 0 and t for t greater than or equal to 0.

89
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:31,450
And of course, because this is an integral u0(t) is the derivative of u1(t).

90
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:38,430
And the final function we're going to look at is is a function called a Dirac delta function.

91
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:45,840
This is modelled by this circuit. Again, you've got a constant current source resistor and the switch.

92
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,150
This time we're going to drive the current through an inductor. With inductance L.

93
00:11:51,150 --> 00:12:01,470
So the voltage across the inductor is the output of this circuit. And when the switch is closed, what's gonna happen?

94
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:07,200
Well, this is going to be defined by a derivative.

95
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:15,000
So the voltage is equal to or proportional to the inductance times, the derivative of the current.

96
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,140
So L di/dt. Because the switch closes instantaneously

97
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:32,070
at t = 0 then the current iL = is x u0(t). Or is times the step function.

98
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:38,210
Thus, vL. = is times L times the derivative of the step function.

99
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:47,310
Now the derivative of the step function is an issue because it's discontinuous at t = 0.

100
00:12:47,310 --> 00:13:00,090
However, we know it must have these properties integral of this function which we'll call delta(tau) must equal u0(t).

101
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:06,540
And we also need delta(t) to be zero for all [values of] t that aren't t = 0.

102
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:17,610
So what does this function look like? Function as an integral, finite integral equal to the unit step but is undefined elsewhere.

103
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:23,490
Well it looks something like this. So it's just a little sudden step.

104
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:34,840
In fact, this is an infinitely high, big step. But it does have a unit integral (area = 1).

105
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,940
So in Matlab, the way we can prove that we can define

106
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:46,900
is and L to be symbols. And then we can compute vL(t) of is = L * diff(u0(t)).

107
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:54,640
And again, we're using a symbolic toolbox here to do algebraic differentiation.

108
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,440
So let's run that. And you can see the result is L times is.

109
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:11,390
times this function which matlab called the dirac(t), because the function delta(t) is named after scientist called Dirac.

110
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:19,370
Paul Dirac. So here are some properties of dirac function, which makes it very useful for signal & systems.

111
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:27,050
The first one is the property of sampling. So if we have some function of time, some continuous function of time,

112
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:40,680
when we multiply that function of time by delta delayed by a seconds, then that's equal to the function

113
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,750
evaluated at a times

114
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:54,250
delta(t-a). So the continuous function is replaced by a sample of the continuous function at one particular value.

115
00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:02,210
t = a. And when t = 0 then f(t)delta(t) = f(0)delta(t).

116
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:07,580
Since t is, a = 0. So f(0) is the result of that.

117
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,610
We call that sampling.

118
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:21,320
There's another property that is quite useful, it's called a sifting property, and it comes about because the integral of the delta(t) function is 1

119
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:32,790
So if we take the integral of some function, multiplied by delta(t - alpha), then obviously what we've got then is f(alpha).

120
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,450
Inside the integral. And so that's just a constant.

121
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:43,350
And therefore, the. The value of this is f(alpha)

122
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:55,840
So the integral of the delta function is one. And so what we get back is a constant, which is f(alpha) x 1, which is f(alpha).

123
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:02,530
You can take derivatives of delta functions for various other operations in general.

124
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:10,690
The nth derivative of delta is equal to the nth derivative u0(t).

125
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,590
And we call the function first derivative of delta.

126
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:19,870
delta'(t). And the second one, delta''(t).

127
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:28,920
And we've got a triplet. We've got doublets and Tippett's. And so. In order to determine the derivative of these,

128
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:37,320
we use the sampling property and you can show that f delta'(a) is equal

129
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:45,960
to f(a) delta'(t-a) minus the derivative of f(t) [f'(t)] times delta(t - a)

130
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:53,540
So a function defined in terms of the root delta minus the derivative of the function.

131
00:16:53,540 --> 00:17:01,740
evaluated at t = a

132
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:16,380
Also, we can extend the sifting property to show that in general, the integral of f(t)  times delta^n(t - alpha) =  (-1)^n d^nf(t)/dt^n

133
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:27,380
Ievaluated at t = alpha.

134
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,700
We use the previous results sometimes.

135
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,210
This one not so much in this course.

136
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:42,540
So in summary, in this chapter, we've looked at some elementary signals in the theoretical circuits that can be used to generate them.

137
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:48,410
And we're gonna do some evaluation of these in Matlab in the lab to come on [Tuesday],

138
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:54,770
but to take away from this module things you should remember.

139
00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:00,080
So note the unit step defined as the Heaviside function u0(t)

140
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,090
You can synthesise lots of useful signals by using the units step as a gating function

141
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:15,630
The unit ramp function u1(t) is the integral is the step function, and the Dirac Delta function delta(t)is the derivative of the unit step function

142
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,940
We sometimes call it the unit impulse function.

143
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:28,450
The Delta function has sampling and sifting properties that will be useful in the development of time convolution and sampling theory.

144
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:40,070
So later in the class to come on [second hour on Monday] we will.

145
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:45,940
We will work through some examples of these signals.

146
