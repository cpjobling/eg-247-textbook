00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:09,120
Hi, this is Chris Jobling, and welcome to this introductory lecture to our activities in week three of the course,

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,330
EG-247 Digital Signal Processing. Today, I'm going to talk a little bit about using Laplace transforms for circuit analysis,

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:23,550
and I believe this may be a reinforcement of some work that you've been doing with Augustine Egwebe in the Control Systems module.

4
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,810
So it may be a little bit of revision and we'll probably concentrate in the lecture.

5
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,330
on doing a few examples of the sort of things that we want to talk about today.

6
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:40,020
So basically, what I want to cover in this first hour of today's session is, um,

7
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,760
using Laplace transforms for circuit transformation from time to frequency,

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,760
domain, complex frequency domain, complex impedance and complex admittance.

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,860
At the end of this, we should be in a good position to be able to model electrical circuits.

10
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:05,670
At least simple electrical circuits involving inductors, capacitors and resistors using Laplace transforms.

11
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,590
So the first thing we talk about is how we can actually do the transform.

12
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:20,940
And this is relatively straightforward. This picture here shows the resistive network in the time domain.

13
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:32,220
So here we have a resistor connected to a voltage source, and the current flowing through the resistor is given by this equation i_R(t).

14
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:43,200
So from Ohm's law, we know that vR(t) = R times i_R(t) and therefore i_R(t) is vR(t)/R. Very, very straightforward.

15
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,820
You'll notice, also notice that there are no dynamic terms in this equation.

16
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:56,880
No integrals, no derivatives. Therefore, in the complex time domain, um, the only thing that gets transformed are the voltages [and the currents].

17
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,810
So the voltage supplied becomes the transform of the voltage, a function of time.

18
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:13,530
The current becomes a transform of the current. And VR(s) is sti_Ll R times i_R(s),  i_R(s) is sti_Ll VR(s)/R.

19
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,730
So resistors do not change, do not change equations.

20
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,550
The only thing that changes is we transform the voltages and the currents.

21
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:29,110
If you look at an inductive circuit in the same kind of configuration, again, we were applying a voltage source,

22
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:35,490
we've got a current flowing through the inductance, with the induction value is L Henrys

23
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:44,820
in the time domain vL(t) = L times the derivative of the current L di_R(t)/dt.

24
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:52,020
So if we look at the reverse relationship, if we were interested in the current flowing through

25
00:02:52,020 --> 00:03:05,360
the inductance, i_L(t) is equal to 1/L  times the integral of zero to T of vL(t) by dt.

26
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:21,560
And again, if we take transforms of that. Then Vl(s) = sL i_L(s) minus L times i_L(t) at zero, or just before zero time.

27
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,500
This is the initial condition of the current and that's a requirement of the derivative.

28
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:36,000
Remember the transform of the derivative is s L i_L(s) minus the initial condition.

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,610
So. You can see s appears in this equation, telling you that it's a derivative.

30
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:51,650
And if we were to look, consider the current rearranging this equation in terms of current, we'd get VL(s)/(Ls)

31
00:03:51,650 --> 00:04:04,770
plus the initial condition of L i_L(0-), which is, as I said at the time just before zero time over s.

32
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:14,910
And in model terms, and we can replace the equation for the inductor by sL rather than just L,

33
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:22,140
we have transformed variables VL(s) and i_L(s) flowing in this system and we have a voltage source

34
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:33,270
which exists, just initially, providing the initial current in the circuit.

35
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,730
In the time domain, um, if you look at the capacitive network, same sort of arrangements,

36
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,780
capacitor here, current flowing through the capacitor, voltage across the capacitor,

37
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,790
we know that the current is equal to C times the derivative of the voltage across the capacitor.

38
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,970
So i_C(t) = C d v_C(t)/dt.

39
00:04:53,970 --> 00:05:09,270
And again, if we want to calculate the voltage across the capacitor, it's 1/C times the integral from minus infinity to t of i_C(t) dt.

40
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:20,140
And so again, we take Laplace transforms of those equations i_C(s) = sCV_C(s) - C v_C(0-),

41
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:26,050
which is the initial condition, initial voltage, again because of the derivative rule.

42
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:38,050
And if we rearrange this equation to have v_C(s) as the output, then it's i_C(s)/sC C + v_C(0-)/s.

43
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:46,420
And again, we can model this as as shown here. The transform equation for the capacitor is 1/sC.

44
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:52,690
We have initial condition v_C(0-)/s appearing as an additional voltage source.

45
00:05:52,690 --> 00:06:07,230
And of course, the current flowing is going to be sCV_C(s) - Cv_C(0-).

46
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,350
So in the class, there will be some examples that we work through.

47
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:19,860
I won't bother showing you those now. The other topic I just wanted to introduce you to is the idea of complex impedance.

48
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:32,340
Once we have, um, our um, resistive values, inductive values and so on represented as transforms rather than derivatives and integrals.

49
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:41,910
Then we can start to think of complex impedance or the equivalent resistance, if you like, of a component defined in the s-domain.

50
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:51,240
So here we've got a simple RLC circuit consisting of resistor, an inductor and a capacitor. The transformed variables of those component values.

51
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:59,100
Impedance is for those are R, sL and 1/sC, and we're ignoring initial conditions in this particular equation.

52
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:09,060
And this the the transform of the source voltage is V_s(s) and the output voltage in this particular case is voltage across the capacitor,

53
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,460
which is equal to v_out(s).

54
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:20,570
So the current flowing through the circuit, we've got the voltage going out, we can calculate the impedance of the circuit.

55
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:28,790
So the sum R + sL + 1/sC is the total opposition to the current flow in the circuit.

56
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:38,360
Therefore, the current in the circuit is equal to the supplied voltage divided by this impedance R + sL + 1/sC.

57
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:45,580
And as we know from Ohm's law, the impedance is defined as the ratio of V to I.

58
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:51,230
Therefore, the impedance in the circuit is simply this.

59
00:07:51,230 --> 00:08:00,340
This value here, which we derived already R + sL + 1/sC.

60
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:08,980
Now we can find the current in a circuit by dividing the voltage by this impedance.

61
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:14,850
So the impedance is this and we can calculate the currents.

62
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:24,880
And since this is the total resistive force to the current, then this is the circuit input impedance for this particular circuit.

63
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,490
Again, we will do some exercises in the, in the class.

64
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:38,680
Another way of looking at impedance is admittance. If we take current as as the input, then we can.

65
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,390
It's more often more useful to calculate the impedance, the admittance

66
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:53,470
rather, and certainly for parallel circuit, it's more convenient to to represent the resistance to the 

67
00:08:53,470 --> 00:09:01,480
current as as an admittance rather than impedance. So here we've got a parallel connexion of an admittance G,

68
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:09,550
and the equivalent admittance of the inductor is the reciprocal of the impedance, which is one over 1/sL and for the capacitor

69
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:23,440
Again, the reciprocal of 1/sC is sC. And for and admittance we can determine voltage as I/Y and Y is equal to the sum of those

70
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:34,440
admittances so is G + 1/sL + sC. So this Y(s) is called a complex input admittance of this parallel circuit.

71
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:47,590
And again, we'll do an example in the class. So that's been a very quick introduction to the topic to be covered in the first half of week 3's class.

72
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:52,810
Um, as as you can see, it's going to be mostly an example class and hopefully we'll work,

73
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:59,530
We'll get you to work through some some stuff in that class.

74
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,349
So I'll see you next week.
