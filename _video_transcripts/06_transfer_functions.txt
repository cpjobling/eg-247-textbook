00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:08,670
This is Chris Jobling again. Just checking in to make another recording for the second half of week three.

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:18,720
We are going to be talking about transfer functions. So the agenda is to talk about transfer function. In the class we'll do some examples, and then

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:33,280
We'll look at how we use MATLAB for looking at transfer functions using the so-called LTI transfer function block. And taking that into simulation.

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,040
So, for circuits, we're doing circuit analysis with Laplace transforms,

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:47,770
and what we are typically dealing with is voltage inputs to voltage outputs and zero initial conditions.

6
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:54,700
So we have a definition of something called a voltage transfer function, which I call G sub v here [G_v(s)].

7
00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:00,490
G_v(s) = V_out(s)/V_in(s). Of course there's nothing stopping us

8
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:05,230
dealing with currents or just conductance circuits or admittance circuits as well,

9
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:13,120
where current might be one of these variables in this kind of equation. So as an example of that,

10
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:22,840
if we're interested in currents, then we might have a transfer function representing a current transfer function, G sub i [G_i(s) = I_out(s)/I_in(s)] like this.

11
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,610
So what I want to do in the class is to derive an expression for the transfer function for a circuit.

12
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:34,330
Um, we've got, uh, various components and this is the circuit diagram.

13
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,640
So we look at that in the in the lecture. The output is across

14
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,960
those three components R_L, L and C.

15
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,050
So that will be in the class.

16
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:59,810
Um, MATLAB gives us a set of powerful tools for looking at, um, transfer functions, it has both transfer function definition for numerical analysis,

17
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:08,600
but you can also use the Laplace transform operators to manipulate transfer functions in the symbolic domain.

18
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:15,350
Um, it's worth having a look at this document [tf_matlab.m], which, um, I've, uh, just downloaded.

19
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,770
Um um, we have a look at that in class.

20
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:31,460
That's, uh, basically a script that says a lot about transfer functions and what they can be used for, so we will have a look at that in class.

21
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:43,790
And in terms of the., In terms of the transfer function, we can also simulate transfer functions using the transfer function blocks inside simulators.

22
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,980
So this is what that would look like in Simulink, this is the sort of thing we could do with it.

23
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:55,970
Again, we will demonstrate that in the class with this example.

24
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:03,740
So that's basically what we be covering in class, again more a sort of hands on session, hopefully.

25
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:10,440
And if you come prepared to do a little bit of maths, you will, we will have a successful session.

26
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,702
So I'll see you then. Bye.
