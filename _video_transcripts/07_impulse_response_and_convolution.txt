00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,550
Hi, this is Chris Jobling again.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:14,220
This is the pre-video for the session which will take place in week four, in which we're going to talk about the impulse response and convolution.

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:20,220
So this is the background reading to the course, basically we are going to start off by

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,450
looking at impulse response of systems and from that develop an idea of time convolution.

5
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:36,900
And then we'll look at how that can be used to determine the linear time invariant system response to any signal.

6
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:43,890
This is going to involve integration by parts. Tricky operation mathematically.

7
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,510
But if we use a Laplace transform, it's simply multiplication.

8
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,520
So that turns out to be much easier to apply and we'll use

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:05,230
We'll show how that works in this in this session. The agenda is to be like this. In the first hour,

10
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:13,060
we'll talk about even and odd functions of time and time convolution. Quickly go through these slides again at the beginning of that session,

11
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:23,500
probably, and then we'll do some examples. And in the second hour, we'll concentrate on on graphical evaluation of convolution integrals.

12
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:29,590
We'll do some examples and we'll look at the system response by Laplace.

13
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:38,290
So we start off by talking about even and odd functions of time. You should have covered this in last year's Signals and Systems course.

14
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:47,890
So I'm just really going to remind you what we mean by even and odd functions because we need to, in order to develop the idea of convolution,

15
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:56,800
we need to know what the what kind of function the delta function is - the Dirac delta function [i.e. Even or Odd].

16
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:09,220
So by definition, an even function of time is one which is symmetrical around the the y axis or zero time axis.

17
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:17,440
So, for example, some function f(t) is even if f(-t) is the same as f(t).

18
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:27,070
So we don't change the function by reflecting the function around the the y axis.

19
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:33,010
Any polynomial [in t] that has even coefficients is going to be an even function.

20
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:42,010
So, for example, cos(t) can be expanded out to 1 - t^2/2! + t^4/4! + t^6/6! + ... 

21
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,570
and all the powers of t are even and therefore

22
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,980
cos(t) is even and you can easily determine that for yourself by plotting cos(t).

23
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,290
of course. Here are some more pictures of even functions.

24
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:03,340
f(t) = t^2 is even; f(t) = t^2 + some constant k is even; 

25
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:10,010
And this weird function here is even, even though it maybe doesn't have a definition that I can write down.

26
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,180
Odd functions of time 

27
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:22,040
By the same process are essentially mirrors of each other only if you mirror both about the y axis and the time axis.

28
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:29,030
So for, an odd function of time, the definition is -f(-t) = f(t)

29
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:36,410
So if you think about that function, what you're doing is you're reflecting about the y axis (f(-t))

30
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:42,770
and you're also reflecting about the time axis by multiplying by minus, a negative sign (-f(-t))

31
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,430
So you have to go through two mirrors, one around the y axis,

32
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:53,180
one on the x axis to get back to the original function with an odd function of time.

33
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:58,760
So polynomials with odd coefficients and no constants are odd functions, for example,

34
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:06,050
sin(t) can be expanded as t - t^3/3! and so on, and that each.

35
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:15,650
those are all odd powers of t and therefore sin(t) is an odd function and you can easily verify this by plotting the sine function.

36
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,410
And here are some more examples.

37
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:29,990
f(t) - the straight line mt is an odd function, as is t^3, because the the negative values are a mirror image of the the positive values.

38
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:37,190
And of course, this function, essentially the sine function is odd.

39
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:49,040
So there are some observations we can carry forth from this for an odd function, f(0) is going to be 0. If f(t) = 0

40
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,880
We can't conclude f(t) is and odd function because f(t) = t^2 is even not odd.

41
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,070
as, of course, f(t) = 0 if t = zero.

42
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:07,940
So [f(0) = 0] is a condition, but it's not a sufficient condition.

43
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:17,210
Um, if you take two even functions of two odd functions, you multiply them together, you're going to get an even function.

44
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:25,000
And then if you multiply an odd function by an even function, you're going to get an odd function back.

45
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:39,410
So in the following slides, we're going to have f sub e [f_e]) standing for the even function and f subscript o [f_o] standing for odd functions and therefore.

46
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:48,140
We can derive these integrals. It turns out that if you take the time integral over a range for an even function,

47
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:56,570
it's going to be twice the same integral computed over one of the periods from zero to t.

48
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:03,590
So in other words, you can save a calculation [because] you don't have to compute the integral from -T to

49
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:10,760
zero because essentially it's covered by the zero to T function for an odd function.

50
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,120
And because the two sides are mirror images of each other.

51
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:23,240
if we take the same integral across the period from -T to T, the integral is going to be zero.

52
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,010
We can take this a little bit further if we have some arbitrary function, f(t),

53
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:34,490
which is neither odd nor even we can always represent it as an even function or an odd function

54
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:42,350
by using these two formulae. An even function f_e(t) = (1/2)(f(t) + f(-t)) the even function,

55
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:49,690
The odd function f_o(t) = (1/2)(f(t) - f(-t)).

56
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:54,350
Putting these then we can always represent any signal.

57
00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:05,200
Basically, as the sum of an even and an odd function. So the first example, which we won't cover now,

58
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:15,220
which we'll just quickly review in the lecture is the question "is the Dirac delta function (delta(t)) an even on an odd function of time?"?" This is a special function

59
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:26,500
It has infinite height, zero width, defined only at time equals zero. Is it odd or even? There is some analysis in the notes,

60
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,460
which we'll quickly run though in the lecture, which will answer that question.

61
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:40,060
But I can tell you, because I need to tell you for the next few slides, that in fact Delta turns out to be an even function of time.

62
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,170
So let's move on to time convolution. This is the main topic today.

63
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:51,370
This is what we want to really get our handles on and what I want you to think, think about in your head, if you can,

64
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:57,730
is that we have some kind of system defined by some kind of black box shown here in the block diagram.

65
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:06,280
And we have a output from that system, which we call h(t), which is going to be the impulse response of this system.

66
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:21,220
So I imagine the system is subjected to an impulse delta(t) and h(t) then represents the impulse response of that system.

67
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:32,450
So in general, we can we can basically sweep that delta function across all time values by introducing an extra term -tau here.

68
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:43,120
And so for any value [impulse] delta(t - tau) we're going to get a response, which is h(t - tau).

69
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:55,770
OK, so because of the sampling properties of the impulse, the output response will be defined by h(t - tau).

70
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:07,000
(Or tav, I thing tau is pronounced tav!) So let's add an arbitrary input to this, let's take some signal u(t).

71
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:17,530
And let's just assume that at some value of tau, this value of u(t) is equal to your u(tau).

72
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:25,090
And because of the sampling property of the delta function, if we apply this function to the Delta.

73
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:30,040
Of course, then the output is going to be u(tau).

74
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:38,860
So this this here is going to give us the the sampling of u(tau), which is the value.

75
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:53,450
And so the outputs is going to be u(tau) times the the impulse response for the time delayed delta function.

76
00:09:53,450 --> 00:10:01,650
And then if we integrate both sides of that expression for all values of tau from minus infinity to infinity,

77
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:09,710
when we make use of the fact that the delta function is even, that is if we reverse the order of the t in tau values here,

78
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:17,420
we won't change anything and what we can do then is write down expression like this.

79
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:24,590
We can take the integral of the input u(tau) delta(t - tau) d tau.

80
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:30,350
But also we could rewrite that as tau - t and it would give us the same answer.

81
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,900
Because this is this is an even function.

82
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:43,130
So we can either either of those two values and they would be equivalent and then we can look at what happens to the integral from both those two cases.

83
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:48,410
So in the first case, we have what we had before on the previous slide.

84
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:52,910
And the second example we reverse the arguments for the u

85
00:10:52,910 --> 00:11:03,560
is t - tau and h(tau). And then because of the sifting property, when you integrate a delta function,

86
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:13,010
you just end up with the value of the function at the point at which a delta is defined, and that in both of these cases is going to u(t).

87
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:17,090
So the integral disappears on the left-hand-side of this block diagram,

88
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:22,880
and we're left with the integral on the right-hand-side, which is what we call the convolutional integral.

89
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:37,010
So this represents the response of this system, whose impulse response is given by this value [h(t)] to an arbitrary input u(t).

90
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:44,760
So. That integral, because we're dealing with linear systems is going to be equivalent, these two give

91
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,020
us the same answer. Which you use in practice depends really on the problem,

92
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,410
which is the easiest to to set up.

93
00:11:52,410 --> 00:12:00,960
It will depend on the nature of the two signals that you are multiplying here, the impulse response, or the the input to the system.

94
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:07,200
So if we know the impulse response of a system, we can compute its time response to any input by using either of the integrals.

95
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,250
And it turns out that the impulse response of a system is actually quite fundamental.

96
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,450
It is basically the dynamics of the system itself,

97
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:25,020
as we'll see in a later demonstration. In order to try to solve these kinds of problems in practice,

98
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,750
it's useful to to take on a little bit of graphical knowledge and sort of think about

99
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:37,260
the problem because often we're dealing with piece wise continuous system signals.

100
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:43,230
And so we need perhaps to just split up the integral into parts and we use a graphical method for that.

101
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:51,830
And there's a visualization tool called convolutiondemo, which we will play with in the lab, but I'll show you very quickly now.

102
00:12:51,830 --> 00:13:02,090
So if I just execute this command, don't worry about the error messages you see, what we've got here is a sine wave and an exponential term.

103
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:12,260
One input here is exp(-1*t). the other one is sin(2*pi*t), and we're displaying from minus two to five.

104
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:19,370
And what you'll see is as I move this across. we are computing the integral of the convolution integral.

105
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,420
So what is what's happening here is that we have reversed one of the signals.

106
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:31,610
So it's mirrored around the y axis and then we move it, we sweep it through the signal.

107
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:42,530
And as we do that we are computing the area of the two signals and building up a

108
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:53,380
waveform down here essentially is the cumulative integral as we go through the whole sweep.

109
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,200
But you can also see down here,

110
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:05,630
it may not be very clear up the video, but there is a little dotted line from the edge of this and to go down to show the.

111
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:22,050
point on the output graph. If I go to the peak there, you can see that the integral is growing and then it starts to decrease again.

112
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:32,150
But we will illustrate that in a bit more detail and do some more examples.

113
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:38,960
So, so the graphical method, which will go through in your class will review this slide again in the class,

114
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:50,000
so I won't dwell on it now. And we'll do some examples.

115
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:59,290
Including setting up the system using that demo system I just showed you. We'll also do some of the integrals as well.

116
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:07,330
So final the bit of this this session will look at system response by Laplace and we

117
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:14,320
will recall hopefully from the one of the properties of the Laplace transform.

118
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:24,440
If you take the first transform of the convolution, which is written like this, this represents that integral that I showed you on the previous slides.

119
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,800
Then the equivalent Laplace transform is simply the product of the two transforms of the individual signals.

120
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:40,900
So F(s) G(s) gives us the Laplace transform of the convolution f(t) convolved with g(t).

121
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:47,140
This, this can rather simplify the computation and the maths and again I will give an example

122
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:58,340
using that example from the textbook. We also for homework, ask you to do the same thing using

123
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,380
The convolution integral,

124
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:09,980
So there will then be a lab where we will explore convolution integral in more detail and you should then have good understanding of convolution,

125
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:16,010
which will be very useful going forward to digital systems later.

126
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:25,160
So that was the pre-lecture, and we will review some of these slides again in the actual session as necessary.

127
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:33,410
But you are now ready, I think, to to explore the idea of convolution and I'll see you on Monday.

128
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,580
Thanks.
