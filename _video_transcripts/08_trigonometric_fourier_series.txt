00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:12,030
Hi, Chris Jobling here with the first of three recordings, for pre-lectures for week five, where we're going to talk about Fourier series.

2
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,240
And we start off with a little bit of revision of the trigonometric Fourier series,

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,180
which basically allows us to take any periodic wave form and approximate it by

4
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,550
a DC component and a summed series of fundamental harmonic sinusoidal waveforms.

5
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:38,610
We have lots of applications of this in many branches of electronics, but it's particularly important for signal processing and communications.

6
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:44,790
I think this is a revision, so I'm not going to spend a lot of time going through the Maths for Fourier series.

7
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,600
We will give you an example of how we compute these things in MATLAB.

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,160
But I did want to give you a motivating example, so that's the first thing I'll do.

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:02,520
And then we'll look at wave analysis, the trig. Fourier series in some outline and look at symmetry and how we compute the coefficients.

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:10,200
And finally, let's say a few words about the Gibbs phenomenon. Um, and it won't be particularly examined,

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,540
Any of this, and we'll be looking in more detail at the Exponential Fourier series in the next short video.

12
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,090
But as an example, I've got this Fourier series demo, which is available online.

13
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,410
So if we go follow this link to the site,

14
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:34,920
you will see on this page there is this application here which I've downloaded and I've unpacked it inside my downloads folder.

15
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:44,280
So if I go to MATLAB, you can see I've got this in downloads and I can run the, run the command by typing "fseriesdemo".

16
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,020
And here we've got a square wave with some DC component.

17
00:01:49,020 --> 00:02:00,870
We've set the period to 10 seconds and at the moment we've got zero coefficients and we can move this slider to change the number of coefficients,

18
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,260
sinusoidal coefficients that we want to represent this signal.

19
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:16,290
And if I make it one, you can see that there is a sine wave that sort of fits the period of the of the square wave.

20
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,910
So now that this is essentially the same period at certain points, in fact,

21
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:26,670
they do match up with zero crossing points the same way with the square wave of the same values.

22
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,750
These bottom pictures are showing what we call line spectrum,

23
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:38,070
which are the exponential Fourier series coefficients, and we look at those and in detail later.

24
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:45,120
We see that we have a negative and a positive coefficient and that they are in fact, complex conjugates of each other.

25
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,410
They can see this because the phase is different in each case.

26
00:02:49,410 --> 00:03:01,420
So if I raise the number to two, that doesn't change anything because there are second

27
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:10,190
harmonics that actually can be made to match the signal, so all the even harmonics actually zero for this particular waveform.

28
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:20,060
And uh, if we move up to three, you can see we've introduced another harmonic (the third) at three times the frequency of the original signal.

29
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,740
And let's introduced another couple of exponential terms.

30
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:34,100
And if we continue up, we will see the all the even ones are always zero, the odd ones are decreasing amplitude of things.

31
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,900
But the phase is always the same in each case.

32
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:48,260
And as we do that you can see you get more and more little waveforms in here and you can keep going until the maximum.

33
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:58,460
This particular value is 15, although we can change that if we want to.

34
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,210
(No, it looks like 15 *is* the maximum.)

35
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:11,090
And so we get the original waveform and we look at the error, we can see there is an error in the in the approximation,

36
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:16,780
which doesn't seem to improve, certainly at the crossing points.

37
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,220
That's because of Gibbs phenomenon, which we'll talk about a little bit.

38
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:28,860
So the important things from this is that you can approximate a periodic wave from by adding together harmonics of sine waves.

39
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:38,700
And these, these sine waves can be represented by exponential line spectra in the negative and the positive frequency.

40
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:45,840
And we can change that from coefficient number to frequency by switching this little switch here.

41
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,380
So quite a useful tool for visualizing wave forms,

42
00:04:49,380 --> 00:05:00,000
and you've got a whole bunch of wave forms that you can look at in this tool and we'll look at that in the lab and at the end of the week.

43
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:09,270
So returning to the the presentation then, having sort of motivated ourselves just a few words to say about the wave analysis itself,

44
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:18,390
which is what for the Fourier series is based on the was developed by Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier, who had these dates.

45
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:24,780
He discovered that any periodic signal can be represented a series of harmonically related sinusoids,

46
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:30,010
and a harmonic is a frequency whose value is an integer multiple of some fundamental frequency.

47
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:42,010
So in the case of the square wave, the fundamental frequency was the, uh, the wave form that gives a period of 10 seconds and.

48
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:46,420
For a frequency two megahertz, three megahertz, four megahertz are the second,

49
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,560
third and fourth harmonic of a sinusoid with a fundamental frequency one megahertz.

50
00:05:50,560 --> 00:06:00,040
OK? And we can represent the trigonometric series by then a sum of these cosine and sine terms.

51
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:06,490
The frequency in the cosine and sine terms is the fundamental, or sume integer multiple of the fundamental.

52
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:15,990
And we have these coefficients a1, a2, etc, matching the the multiplier of the harmonic and the cos in the sin terms.

53
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,460
And we have a's and b's and we have this half a0, which represents DC,

54
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:27,010
and we can rewrite this in a more compact form, which might be more confusing to people,

55
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,250
but is in fact is much easier to write,

56
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:39,070
which basically says f(t) is equal to half of a0 plus a the sum from n = 1 to infinity of terms a_n cos (n omega_0 t).

57
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:45,820
And b_n sin( n omega_0 t), where omega_0 radians

58
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,780
per second is the fundamental frequency.

59
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:57,910
So some notation about this. a note a0/2, is a constant represents the DC or average component of the signal f(t),

60
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,940
which may be zero, or nonzero. It was zero the example I just showed you.

61
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:10,190
Um, the terms with coefficients a1 and b1 represent the fundamental component pf f((t) [at omega_0]

62
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:19,280
and a2 and b2 are the second harmonic component with a frequency of 2 omega_0 and so on.

63
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,470
Since for any periodic function,

64
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:30,600
we can express that as a Fourier series as it follows that the sum of the DC, fundamental, second and so on must produce the waveform f(t).

65
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:38,640
So this is how the sort of thing works, we've got two or more sinusoids, so we've got a fundamental sinusoid here, the red line.

66
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,820
We've got one at twice the frequency, the Green Line.

67
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:48,330
And if we add those two together, what results is not a sinusoid but a strangely shaped waveform.

68
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:56,250
By adjusting the amplitude we can get, we can make these waveforms sort of match any, any kind of periodic signal.

69
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:09,030
That's the basic idea. To evaluate the actual coefficients, we need to go turn to mathematics, and we have these expressions here.

70
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,980
For example, the DC component a0 is obtained by this integral.

71
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:18,780
1/T0, where T0 is the period, of the integral from 0 to T0 
72
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:26,250
of f(t) dt. Which is going to be 1/pi integral from zero to 2pi f (theta) d theta is you.

73
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:38,620
wish to do the analysis in terms of [angle] theta. I've just noticed a little mistake there, which I'll just correct.

74
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,450
And a_n is given by this integral, 1/T0 integral from 0 to T0 f(t) 

75
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:56,440
cos n omega_0 t dt or 1/2pi integral from 0 to 2pi f(theta0 cos n theta d theta) and b_n has got a similar relationship.

76
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:02,830
Note the the f(t) is the standard function of time which we're trying to synthesize.

77
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,500
And of course, that requires us to do this integration,

78
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:12,520
which is a integration by parts of a function of time with cos(t), or f(T) with sin(t).

79
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,740
And these these can be clearly complicated expressions you end up with cosine/sine terms appearing.

80
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:30,580
But since we have orthogonal functions, a lot of the terms disappear, but it's still a bit of a pain to compute, unless you've have got a computer.

81
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:38,320
There are some things, some results of symmetry that can make the computation somewhat simpler.

82
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:48,400
So, for example, if f(t) is odd, it's an odd signal, a0 = 0 [f(0 = 0 for an odd function] then all the a_n terms will be zero and there'll be no cosine terms,

83
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,810
[cos is an even function] so all the a_n's will be zero for all of n greater than zero.

84
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:59,110
If f(t) is an even function, there'll be no sine terms because sine is an odd functions.

85
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:07,060
So all the b_n's will be zero for all n > 0, and the DC may or may not be zero, depending on the waveform.

86
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,170
If f(t) has half way symmetry, only the old harmonics will be present.

87
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:17,710
The values a_n and b_n is zero for all even values of n, 0, 2, 4, ...

88
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,010
So that's a useful check. We need to check whether the signal is

89
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:28,090
first of all, odd, whether it's even on if it has half-wave symmetry and that simplifies the computation quite significantly.

90
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:34,410
If we can take those things into account. And in the lecture, we look at some examples to

91
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:42,360
better understand what half-wave symmetry means and how we can determine whether the signal has it not.

92
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:54,390
So just to sort of emphasize this, the odd function we saw last week is defined as (t) = -f(-t) and sin(t) is an odd function,

93
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,810
and even function is one for which f(t) = f(-t).

94
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:04,200
And we saw that cos(t) is an even function. And we have this additional idea of halfway symmetry.

95
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,870
This basically says that we've got a periodic function with period T 

96
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:18,120
for which f(t) = f(t + T) by definition a periodic function. A periodic function

97
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:26,770
with period T has half-wave symmetry if t(t) = - f(t + T/2). And

98
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:35,360
by removing certain coefficients from the answer can simplify things considerably.

99
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:45,720
So by exploiting these symmetries, we can change the limits of the integrals for a_n and b_n in the Fourier series.

100
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,390
Um, we could also we could instead, for example,

101
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:59,240
instead of integrating from zero to 2pi we can choose to integrate from -pi two to +pi. If the function is odd,

102
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,600
even, or has half-wavw symmetry compute a_n and b_n integrating from 0 to pi and multiplying by two.

103
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:14,150
And if we have half-wave symmetry, we can compute, a_na nd b_n by integrating between zero and pi/2 and multiplying the result by four.

104
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:21,290
So these things make the computation simpler.

105
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:29,940
So just give you an example to close this introductory lecture, we're going to compute the trigonometrical Fourier series using MATLAB.

106
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:35,280
And I'd like to use capitals for MATLAB, so let me change the slide.

107
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:43,760
Um, so here we've got a square wave. It has amplitude plus and minus A, period of T seconds.

108
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:52,820
So 2pi radians is tTwo seconds, and this signal has half-wave symmetry.

109
00:12:52,820 --> 00:13:02,840
Because if you take this first half and multiply it by minus one, it's the same as the second half.

110
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,700
So let's do the solution.

111
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:19,730
Well, first of all, let's stop at MATLAB and make it produce nice compact results, and then we'll define some symbols to and apply for this case.

112
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:28,510
t n A and pi going to let n go from one to 11. This is a number of harmonics.

113
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,650
So we've defined that.

114
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:48,730
Then we'll compute the DC component, so a 1/2 a0, is 1/(2*pi)*(int(A, t, 0, pi) + int(-A,t,pi,2*pi)).

115
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,480
So because it's a square wave, we can we can split that.

116
00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:01,430
We could also take account of the half-wave symmetry, which we haven't done in this case.

117
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:11,570
Let me just, uh, temporarily pause this video here and clear all the cells because.

118
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:19,570
We want to do is make sure that we are recomputing these things.

119
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:30,520
So this is what I've just done. So to compute the harmonics then we use the same idea.

120
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:40,840
ai is 1/pi*(int(A*cos(n*t,t,0,pi) + and so on.

121
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:49,180
This will actually give us a, because n is a factor, that will give us a whole set of coefficients.

122
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:56,200
So you can see the a'a are all zero is what we were expecting as sine is 

123
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,570
an odd function and the b's are given by these expressions,

124
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:14,560
4A/pi, 4A/3pi, 4A/5pi, 4A/7pi, 4A/9pi [and 4A/11pi] and notice also that the even coefficients are all zero.

125
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:24,370
This is because the signal has half-wave symmetry. So we can reconstruct f(t) from the harmonic sine functions.

126
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,300
So f(t) is going to be half the DC value initially.

127
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,630
And then for all the values that we've computed,

128
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:40,030
we can add in the coefficient ai times cos of the harmonic frequency and plus bi times sin function

129
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:51,570
remembering that a's were already the zero and then f(t) for the total signal is equal to this expression here.

130
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:57,270
And you can see now we've got a sine term appearing, a sine of some harmonic frequency time appearing.

131
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:08,630
And we can plot we can plot that. First of all, making the coefficients numeric.

132
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:15,960
And then printing them with four significant digits.

133
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:32,970
So that's converted the the symbolic expressions to these numeric expressions, and then with this, we can plot the results.

134
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:38,120
And ezplot is our standard plot function for plotting symbolic functions, as we've seen before.

135
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:49,510
And now you get an approximation of the original square wave made up of 11 [even] harmonics in this particular case.

136
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:53,920
And just to add on the original signal.

137
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:00,070
Um, that's what I've done here, so I've added in a [square-wave made from] Heaviside functions which was our original signal.

138
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:11,090
I've done it in this way though we could have done it with using the Heaviside function as well, and we can see that the approximation is not not great.

139
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:19,780
At 11, these is significant ripple. Um, and if you wish to run this expression yourself, you can.

140
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:28,390
You can use this, I provide this MLX file to to do the same, to give you the same results.

141
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:37,380
So the final result then, confirms a0 is zero, that ai is zero because the time function is odd, the bi is zero for i is

142
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:43,270
even because of half-wave symmetry.

143
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:56,470
And so we end up with just the odd coefficients appearing in the results, and this is the result as a sinusoidal expression.

144
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:10,880
And you can do the same things for the shifted wave-form. We'd need to use a slightly different limit on the integrals and you can see we get a similar match.

145
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:23,550
So that's. That ripple that you see in the, in the result there, that's due to this what's called "Gibbs phenomenon".

146
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:37,510
And I'm just going to adjust that little bit so that.

147
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:43,570
So that we get a better slide show, so

148
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:51,040
let me run that as as slide again, so the Gibbs phenomenon basically says because of this relationship,

149
00:18:51,040 --> 00:19:01,420
this is the relationship that we we could have computed. So f(t) is 4A/pi times sine omega0 t plus 1/3 sine 3 omega 0 t, 

150
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:08,980
third harmonic + 1/5 sin 5 omega0 t + 1/7 sin 7 omega0 t and so on, so you can see the pattern.

151
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:17,480
It's 4A/pi times the sum for all n is odd, 1/n  sine omega0 T.

152
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:26,170
But it doesn't matter how many terms we take. Well, this is the approximation for the first 11.

153
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:36,910
We will get more and more like a square wave the more terms we add, but we never get rid of this, this large peak here, and that's sort of ringing.

154
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:46,150
And this is because we can't really compute the integral of of something that's changing as quickly as a step from here to here.

155
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:55,040
And because of this discontinuity, you get this this Gibbs effect of not quite matching the signal.

156
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:03,220
That's something to be aware of when you are synthesizing waveforms from square waves. You'll you have seen this in the first year lab.

157
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:09,910
I think when you tried to take a square wave, integrate it to produce a triangle wave,

158
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:18,850
You got a much better result if you had a triangle wave and then filtered that to get the fundamental back as a sine wave,

159
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:32,770
then you would have done that, had you tried to directly filter the square. We'll come back to that point in a later lecture when we talk about.

160
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:42,010
Power factor correction, that kind of thing. OK, so that's a first introduction to Fourier series. It's meant to be watched sort of independently.

161
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:48,370
We will do a little exercise in the class identifying half-way symmetry.

162
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,820
But this is background, really.

163
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:59,140
We're going to talk about the Exponential Fourier series in a bit more detail in the class, and we'll give some examples based on that.

164
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:06,137
And that's to come. So thanks for watching and we'll see you in class the beginning of week five. Bye!
