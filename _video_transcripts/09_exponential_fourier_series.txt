00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:11,730
Hi, this is Chris Jobling making a pre-lecture recording for the week five session on Fourier series. Bitterly cold,

2
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,340
which is why I'm wrapped up with the scarf and everything.

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:26,040
I hope you're nice and warm where you are. It's been terrible weather today, but gives me a chance to catch up on a bit of work, I suppose.

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:33,270
Anyway, we're going to talk today about a exponential Fourier series.

5
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:43,170
This is the agenda. There's some background. I've made some notes on the trigonometric Fourier series, so if you follow the link here,

6
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:53,850
it'll take you to this page where eventually you'll see some notes on Fourier series, where it comes from,

7
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,960
something on half-wave symmetry and so on,

8
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:08,850
which is preparation for this session. Reminds you how we compute the Fourier series, gives you some MATLAB scripts for doing so.

9
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,970
And we'll look at this more in the laboratory, so going to get a feel for how we might do this kind of thing.

10
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,890
I'm not going to go into the trigonometrical Fourier series in this session.

11
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:26,640
I'm going to concentrate instead on the Exponential Fourier Series, which leads us to the Fourier transform.

12
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,890
So it'll give you a chance to have a look at that background reading in advance.

13
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,390
This is what we'll cover in the first hour of two of the Monday's session.

14
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:43,380
I'm going to look at exponents on Euler's equation exponential, Fourier series symmetry, and the exponential Fourier series,

15
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,970
and there'll be some examples which we'll work through in class.

16
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:56,080
And then in the second hour, which I'll make a brief video for in a few minutes, we'll talk about line spectra,

17
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:09,090
power in periodic signals, and steady state response of LTI systems to periodic signals, which is the basis of filtering, as we'll see later.

18
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,630
We're going to start off by just talking about what we mean by the exponential function.

19
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:19,930
exp(at) which very important function because it appears in the solution of differential equations,

20
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:25,450
it appears in Laplace transforms and it appears, as we'll see later, in the Fourier transforms

21
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:30,490
also. It appears all over the place in the tables and
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:38,680
the properties of Laplace transforms, and we're familiar with it from the examples we've already done on circuits and so on.

23
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:47,320
So there's a number of possibilities, depending on the value of this parameter a in the exponential function.

24
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,250
All these functions are a function of time in our context, of course.

25
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:58,900
But what happens and what kind of signals you get depends on the value of a in that expression.

26
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:12,130
So we look at that for a few cases. The first case is when a is a real number. In this situation, we have this issue.

27
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:26,770
This is a plot of a. For particular values. I plotted it in MATLAB and depending on whether a is positive, for example, the blue line.

28
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,550
Negative, the Yellow line, or zero.

29
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:38,590
We get these these different types of response. So you can see for a positive value of a, for a real,

30
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:44,150
We get an increasing exponential signal.

31
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,460
This will go off to infinity. In systems and signals,

32
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:59,590
This is rarely something we want to see because it would eventually, of course, cause us to reach limits in the circuitry.

33
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,520
And we don't, we don't typically design systems to have this kind of response.

34
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:14,230
So we're trying to avoid positive a in control signal systems and lots of other communications work and so on.

35
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,670
So you'll see that positive a is considered to be a bad thing.

36
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:24,940
If a is negative, then we get the decaying exponential, which is a signal which will start off infinity,

37
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:34,360
theoretically, at minus minus t, but will eventually settle down to zero value after some time.

38
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,320
And this is, this is considered to be a stable response.

39
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:49,960
It is this response typically looking for on so negative values of a what we typically looking to achieve. When a is equal to zero?

40
00:04:49,960 --> 00:05:01,630
Of course, it's exp(0) is just one. And so you just get sort of DC value for for that particular situation.

41
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:08,470
We can also have imaginary a, so if a is imaginary, that is, it's got a function, j.

42
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:13,150
Then exp(j omega t) Euler's equation is going to be cos(omega t)

43
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,100
plus j*sin(omega t). And this slide illustrates those two cases.

44
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:30,580
So I think the the green line is a sign of a sin(omega t) and the blue line is cos(omega t).

45
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:41,050
You can see cos starting at one at zero and sine going to one at a quarter the period.

46
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:48,190
So those two signals added together basically gives you your j omega t,

47
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:53,080
which is going to be an imaginary, no a complex number, and you might, what

48
00:05:53,080 --> 00:06:01,750
you can imagine is it's tracing a point on this phaser plot here, so omega t itself.

49
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:09,430
is the angle. And that's continuously changing because omega t is continually growing.

50
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:16,540
So the rate of spinning of this, if you imagine this is a line spinning around the circle,

51
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:26,710
the rate at which it does that depends on omega and t will just just keep going on and on and on as t goes to infinity.

52
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:35,120
So the actual point traced by this line j omega t represents exp(j omega t).

53
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:43,100
And it will be made up of a sine component and a cosine component. So the sine component is the component in the j on the j-

54
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:52,760
axis, here this is the imaginary axis, and the cos component is the position on the x axis, which is the real part.

55
00:06:52,760 --> 00:07:00,020
So this is representing a complex number which is continually changing in a sinusoidal session

56
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:11,710
like this. And this particular case is what we'll typically find when we look at the Fourier transform later on.

57
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:21,730
So some important values of omega t, which we will address in the in the lecture, we'll ask you to look at those in the lecture.

58
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:30,670
And then we've got the case where a is complex, where, which we won't say much about, but effectively the 

59
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,720
Laplace transform is the representation of this case.

60
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:45,780
The s in this expression is essentially a complex a and it's a complex exponential.

61
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,310
Which has got a real out an imaginary part.

62
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:57,740
This typically leads to damped sinusoidal responses, which you typically see in things like control theory and design.

63
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:04,800
So look out for them in EG-243 as they come into stability.

64
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:15,530
The value of the real part needs to be negative to decay exponentially and so on.

65
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:23,420
So stability boundaries and so on are all governed by this particular relationship where a is complex.

66
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:29,540
Two important properties, we will using these in a few minutes.

67
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:38,150
For example, Euler's equations that cos omega t = (exp(j omeg t) + sin(-j omega t))/2.

68
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,280
It's an identity and similarly.

69
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:52,190
sin(omega t) = (exp(j omega t) - j exp(-j omega t))/j2 where i is the imaginary variable, square root of -1.

70
00:08:52,190 --> 00:09:02,100
And very important properties as we'll see because they allow us to generate the exponential Fourier series, which I'll go onto to now.

71
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:11,120
Some notes here. again refer to the notes and for the definitions here and the and the maths behind this. Any wave

72
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:23,630
form, any periodic wave form. f(t) can be represented as the sum of terms like a cos Omega 0 t, Omega 0 is

73
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,610
the fundamental frequency, and a sin Omega 0.

74
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:36,170
These coefficients a1, a2, b1, b2, etc. depend on the on the periodic signal and can be calculated using integrals,

75
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:44,930
as we'll seen on the next slide, I think. And there's also this term here, which is considered to be the DC value of the expression.

76
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:54,960
So by by making up a sum of exponential, sorry sinusoids cos and sine terms, even and odd terms,

77
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:07,440
we can come up with an expression representing a Fourier approximation of of of any function of time, provided it is periodic using this relationship.

78
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:15,960
If we replace the sine and cos terms with the imaginary exponential equivalents, we would get this expression.

79
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,730
And then if we expand that out, gathering termis with the same exponents,

80
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:26,760
we're going to get a term with a2, and another term with b2, one of which is real,

81
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:36,690
the other of which is complex, multiplying by the exponential e to the frequency, omega 0 remember is the fundamental frequency.

82
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:45,900
So we're going to get this kind of relationship appearing for all values of 

83
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:55,740
time and you see, this continues on from negative omega to positive omega.

84
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,940
And then we can define some new coefficients.

85
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:21,170
C -k and C k, which are defined like this. Half of that or that (equivalent) and C 0, which is the DC component, which is a half of a0.

86
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,460
And this leads us to the what we call the exponential Fourier series,

87
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:33,530
which is a representation of the series as a sequence of exponential terms.

88
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:43,550
All as multiples of the fundamental frequency Omega 0 with coefficients corresponding to the value here.

89
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:49,160
So minus two with minus two, minus one with minus one and so on.

90
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:56,830
And compactly, this can be written down as a sum, an infinite sum from minus n to n.

91
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:10,370
Not infinite, I mean, an approximation from -n to n C k exp j k Omega 0, which is fundamental frequency, of t.

92
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:21,910
And those coefficients themselves are obtained from a integral defined as 1/2pi

93
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:32,570
the integral part in the range zero to 2pi of f(Omega 0 t)exp(-j k Omega 0 t),

94
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:50,140
with respect to Omega 0 t. Or, if we want to express this in terms of time 1/T times the integral from zero to T f(t) exp(-j k Omega 0 t) dt. Where T, capital t

95
00:12:50,140 --> 00:13:01,840
here is the period of the periodic waveform. So you can see these two integrals are equivalent: one is looking at the period as an angle from zero to

96
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:07,130
2pi, the other is looking at it a as a time from zero to T.

97
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:16,370
These two, this expression here, f(t)exp(-j Omega 0 t) is typically easier to evaluate than the equivalent expression,

98
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:28,650
which would involve cos and sine terms. So we have both a cos and a sine in the equivalent calculation for the coefficients ak and bk.

99
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:35,850
So the exponential Fourier Series is often easier to compute than the sinusoidal Fourier series.

100
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:46,620
But we can always go back to the sinusoidal Fourier series by recognizing that if we take C k and it's [complex] compliments -k, C -k.

101
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:54,250
that's going to be half this. So ak is C k plus C -k.

102
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:00,160
And similarly, bk is j times C k minus C  -k.

103
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:13,330
So we can always go back from the sinusoidal Fouier series to the exponential Fouier series using these simple, simple, simple operations.

104
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:19,690
When we're computing these things, there are some simplifications we can make, for example,

105
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:29,520
to take account of symmetry in the original signal. All the exponents and coefficients are complex numbers.

106
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:35,340
And this means that some of them disappear if we're dealing with odd numbers.

107
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,450
Others disappear for dealing with even numbers and so on.

108
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:52,380
So for example, for even functions, all the coefficient C k will be real and the odd functions, all the coefficients C k are imaginary.

109
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:58,260
This is relatively easy to prove because cos is an and even function, and sine is an odd function.

110
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:04,770
Therefore, you can work out which coefficients will remain if we're dealing with odd or even functions,

111
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:14,270
which will be made up of either cos or sine respectively. By a similar argument, odd functions have no cosine terms.

112
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:20,230
So the ak coefficient are zero, therefore and

113
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:34,010
both C -k and C k are imaginary in that situation. If we have half-wave symmetry, which is expressed in that pre pre-reading on the [trig.] Fourier transform,

114
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:41,500
if there's half-wave symmetry, then the C k are going to be zero for any n

115
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:54,090
which is even. Actually, that should be k is even. Let me correct that.

116
00:15:54,090 --> 00:16:04,360
Just to let you know, I'll adjust the notes, I'll update the notes on the website after this.

117
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:12,240
If there's no symmetry, the exponential Fourier series of f(t) is going to be complex.

118
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,850
And finally, C -k and C k. These are complex conjugates of each other.

119
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:26,600
So C -k is equal to the complex conjugate of C k for any situation.

120
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:36,510
So that's the end of the pre-class presentation, and they'll are some examples of the work through in the class, but that's the end for now.

121
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:44,370
I'll record another video in a few minutes, which just discusses the second half of this of the class,

122
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:50,640
and I'll put both on the [Canvas] side before the lecture starts. So thanks for watching.

123
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,333
I'll see you in the class.
