00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:08,850
Hi, Chris Jobling, again, this is pre-recording for the second part of Week 5's class,

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:16,980
I'm going to talk about line spectra and their applications in this, and we'll have some examples in the classroom as usual.

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:24,870
So last time we, in the last video, I talked about exponents, and the Euler's equation and we looked at the Exponential Fourier series.

4
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:31,230
We then looked at symmetry and exponential Fourier series on in the class

5
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,490
we will do some examples. This time want to talk about line spectra.

6
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:43,260
I want to talk about power in periodic signals. And I want to talk about steady state response of a linear time invariant system,

7
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,220
or LTI system, to periodic signals, which leads us onto the idea of filters.

8
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:59,310
So we'll start off by talking about line spectra. wWen we've computed an exponential Fourier series.

9
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,110
We want to be able to plot those and the best kind of plot for this kind of thing,

10
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:12,360
because these are end up being complex numbers, is to plot the amplitude and the phase of the harmonics on a frequency scale.

11
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,920
You can't really plot complex numbers against frequency.

12
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,280
You have to split them into, into parts.

13
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:31,080
Your choices really are real and imaginary [parts] or phase and magnitude, and we choose the phase and magnitude type plot.

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,730
So this is what an exponential series typically look like.

15
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:41,800
We do the calculations for this in the examples class that we will run.

16
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,340
And this is essentially

17
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:57,070
the response for a particular type of signal. It's a signal that happens to have [half-wave] symmetry, so you can see that the even terms are zero.

18
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:07,000
And we've got the magnitudes which we're showing as "stem" plots here for negative and positive frequency.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:21,700
And we've got the corresponding phase, which you can see goes between pi/2 and and -pi/2.

20
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:35,550
So to get these line spectra for trigonometric Fourier series, what we do is we take the coefficients, the a0's, the ak's and the bk's.

21
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:42,780
And we get the Fourier series and for a Fourier series, we just basically take the magnitudes,

22
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:54,340
and you can see the line spectrum of just positive frequencies for the corresponding sinusoidal Fourier series.

23
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,880
So in the in the class will work through this example,

24
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:08,980
where we calculate the exponential Fourier series for this periodic waveform, pulsed waveform, with this sort of pulse-width modulation going on.

25
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:15,640
So the width of this pulse depends on w. And it's a fraction of T, the period.

26
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,030
So we'll look at that very important case, and we'll look at that in

27
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:32,900
the class. We'll also look at this example, which is the sequence of impulses, delta functions, for different values of k.

28
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:42,240
And again we will come up with a Fourier series for that example in the class.

29
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:53,700
Once we have these signals represented by essentially line spectra, then what we can do this for is we can measure things like power.

30
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:00,600
So power in periodic signals is given by these equations, we've got energy.

31
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,830
The average power, and the RMS power given by these integrals.

32
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:15,090
You have seen these in the first year signals course I think. You can see there is an integral over the period of the square of the function of time.

33
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:29,790
The average power is that same integral divided by the period, and then the RMS value is the average taken to square root [square root of the average value].

34
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:40,200
Parseval's theorem tells us that we can we can determine the power for a signal by looking at the sum of the average powers of all its harmonic components.

35
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:51,730
So if you've got an harmonic Ck exp(j k Omega 0 t), then Pk is going to be this equation

36
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:57,790
This omega should be the big Omega0 that I was using in my previous notes.

37
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:09,710
So let me let me change that.

38
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:19,720
So, so we've got some consistency. And then I'll have to update the notes.

39
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:29,530
Now I've made this change.

40
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:36,010
So you can see that the average power is integral of the square of these conjugate terms.

41
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:49,810
And since they appear as complex conjugates and you're going to, you're going to get 2 Pk as the power for individual frequency.

42
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:55,690
So the equivalent integral, the integral of f(t)^2 is just simply to compute

43
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:04,540
usually, [the] sum from minus infinite to infinity of the coefficients squared.

44
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:09,730
RMS power, similarly, is this just a square root of that sum.

45
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:21,630
And these, again, very easy to compute. So we will look at another example in the lecture on that.

46
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:26,160
And then we'll talk about power spectrum.

47
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Power spectrum is a plot of a signal where we're taking the average powers rather than the value.

48
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:49,050
This is a typical power spectrum, then, for a circuit that we will look at in the class, you can see that there are no negatives now,

49
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:57,030
because everything is positive because we're taking a square. This is actually a sinc function as we'll see.

50
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:08,140
And when you see that you get the power spectrum and for this particular case, as an all positive sequence.

51
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:15,580
We can use these types of ideas to come up with what we call total harmonic distortion.

52
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:27,350
Let me just tidy up this slide again.

53
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:34,770
[inaudible]

54
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:43,660
[inaudible]

55
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:51,210
And we'll re-run the presentation. The total harmonic distortion.

56
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:57,240
This is the sort of thing you might get in industry when you're running big motors from the mains or whatever.

57
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:07,580
So this is supposed to be a sinusoid, but it's been distorted because of all the inductive and capacitive loads. And what we're interested in,

58
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:17,020
if we're paying for the grid, or we're putting signals back onto the grid that may not be pure sinusoids,

59
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,110
We typically have to pay for that.

60
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:31,950
So we want to know how much distortion we've got, what kind of corrections we might need to make. So we can define total harmonic distortion

61
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:43,500
As, by this. This is the RMS and the total harmonic of distortion.

62
00:08:43,500 --> 00:09:00,990
I'm going to tidy this slide up. The total harmonic distortion is going to be.

63
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:15,050
The total harmonic distortion is defined as the sort of ratio of the average power to the

64
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:21,160
The average power in all the harmonics that shouldn't be present to the total average power of the distorted sine wave.

65
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:27,050
So the total harmonic distortion of the signal. So this is calculated like this.

66
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:31,970
We take the RMS power of the sequence using Parseval's theorem,

67
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:44,270
and then we take the RMS value of the harmonics for k > 1 to the RMS of the fundamental, which is the C1 [term].

68
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:49,220
And that gives us a measure of distortion, if you like, so we can compute this like this.

69
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:54,350
Here is our fundamental frequency and here are all the harmonics.

70
00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:02,570
So we add those together and we divide it by this to give us the THD as a percentage.

71
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:08,440
So that's another computation we can do.

72
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,590
And the last thing I to talk about in this session is the steady-state response of LTI systems,

73
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:23,290
to periodic signals. We can compute this using the exponential Fourier or sinusoidal Fourier serie we've got.

74
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:29,500
It turns out that if we've got a system with an impulse response, h(t) and we give it a complex

75
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:37,330
exponential exp(st) then what's going to come out is going to be H(s) times exp(st).

76
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:51,340
So H(s) is defined as the integral from minus infinity to infinity of h(tau)exp(-s tau) d tau.

77
00:10:51,340 --> 00:11:00,310
And that's going to give us. You know, should be actually tau as well.

78
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:05,560
So I've got a few errors in this presentation, sorry about that.

79
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:18,380
Should all be correct by the time you see them. So in particular, if we take s = j omega, then the output going to be H(j omega).

80
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:28,910
exp(j omega t). And H(s) and H(j omega) are called the system transfer function and system frequency response, respectively.

81
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:42,500
So by superposition, if we have a periodic signal represented by a Fourier series given by this expression here, summation of Ck H(j omega)

82
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:52,790
exp(j k Omega 0), where Omega 0 = T/(2 pi) is the fundamental frequency than y(t) is a Fourier series itself

83
00:11:52,790 --> 00:12:03,530
With coefficients Dk equal to Ck H(jk Omega 0).

84
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:17,300
In other words, the coefficient value of the original signal multiplied by the frequency response of the system at that frequency.

85
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:23,420
And so that depends on the frequency response of the system.

86
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:33,110
So if we put such a signal into a linear time invariant system, you're going to get a modified Fourier series for multiplication

87
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:41,900
with frequency response evaluated at the harmonic frequencies, which means, that it's best illustrated here.

88
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,580
Let's say we've got this kind of input. We've got this kind of response. Notice

89
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:55,880
this is curtailed, so those frequencies are attenuated after, after this third value here,

90
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:03,950
then we're going to eliminate the, the frequencies that are beyond the range of this thing.

91
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:12,780
So this gives us in the way of taking signals and chopping them off if you like at high frequencies or low frequencies. Changing the shape,

92
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:22,540
in other words, of the response by, by applying some design to the circuit here to give us what we want.

93
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:36,690
And that returns the idea of filtering. So the frequency spectrum is given by this H(j k Omega 0) [and that should be capital Omega] which returns 

94
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:45,660
certain frequencies and cuts off others. And clearly I'm going to have to correct all my notes that I've already made available through OneNote,

95
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:51,220
so I'll do that before the lecture.

96
00:13:51,220 --> 00:14:03,250
So that's the end, of the second hour. I'm sorry about the real time edits, but you can see going through a presentation is quite useful,

97
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:10,750
picking up little issues which have given me some time to correct those before you see the notes in the class.

98
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:16,240
But anyway, thanks for watching. See you in class on Monday, hopefully, weather permitting.

99
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:25,013
And thanks. Thanks again for your attention. And next time we'll talk about the Fourier transform.
