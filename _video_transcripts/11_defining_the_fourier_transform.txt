00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,950
Hi, this is Chris Jobling, and this is the first of the pre-lectures for week six,

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:11,790
where we're going to start to look at the Fourier transform. The agenda for this free lecture is,

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,950
we're first of all going to look at the first the Fourier transform as the limit of a Fourier series.

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:22,320
Then we're going to have a look at the mathematical derivation in brief.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:33,210
We'll talk about some special forms of the Fourier transform that relate to various issues around odd and even functions and that kind of thing.

6
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,010
And finally, we'll look at some properties of the Fourier transform.

7
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:44,160
That's what's going to be covered, and we'll finish off with a quick example of how we can use MATLAB to compute these things.

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:56,380
So the Fourier transform, one way of looking at this is it's the limit of a Fourier series for a a periodic function as the period gets very, very long.

9
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:05,700
And to illustrate what I mean by this, we've got an example here where we're using a pulse train,

10
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,920
where the pulse is from -T to +T and the height is one.

11
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,510
Um, and that occurs every T seconds.

12
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:20,190
So the frequency is 2pi/T.

13
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:29,580
The width of the pulse is T/w, where w is 2t0, which is the time of the transitions.

14
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,580
So the idea is that we have this pulse train and we can derive a Fourier series for it because it's periodic.

15
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:42,630
But as we let T go to infinity, we spread out this function more and more.

16
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,890
What you end up with then perhaps is the Fourier transform.

17
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:54,360
The Fourier transform is useful for signals that don't have periodicity. 

18
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,040
So in the previous lecture we came up with this expression.

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,840
So we had, for the coefficients of the exponential Fourier series,

20
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:12,450
we could use this integral 1/2pi integral -pi/w to +pi/w A exp(-j k Omega0 t) d Omega0 

21
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:24,110
and that was the same as A/2pi integral -pi/w to +pi/w exp(-j k Omega0 t) d Omega0.

22
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:29,950
And we computed the light spectra from that. If we take this from a time point of view,

23
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:35,210
we let A = 1, then we'll be like completing these coefficients Ck

24
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:40,190
this time is 1/T, and now we're going to compute [the integral] from -t0 to

25
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:46,460
+t0 exp(-j k Omega0 t) dt, and again, Omega0 is the fundamental [frequency].

26
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:56,350
So we'll complete the analysis on the whiteboard in class, but I'll show you the solution for the video very quickly.

27
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:01,710
You can, and what you can see is, it's right down at the bottom of the notes here.

28
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:26,790
What you see is. Essentially, that you do some analysis and you end up with this function T/2 t0

29
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:33,240
sinc(pi k 2t0/T) ... I'm going to quickly correct that [slide],

30
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:47,220
so pi wouldn't appear in the sync function because it's there already, that's part of the definition of the sinc function.

31
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:58,620
So. So that's that's basically the analysis, and we'll repeat that in class, so you'll get a feel for it.

32
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:14,710
So not a difficult computation, but you then end up with this.

33
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:26,650
There with this sinc function, which you'll see crops up over and over again in Fourier transforms and.

34
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:39,130
And the Ck's are then scaled samples of the real continuous, normalized sinc function, which we could define as sine pi u / pi u.

35
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:49,780
So the function, is it going to be equal to one at u = 0 you and has zero crossings at u = +/- 1, +/- 2, +/- 3, as shown below.

36
00:04:49,780 --> 00:05:06,270
So if we plotted this using MATLAB, excuse me.

37
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,960
We'll eventually get a solution, and that's the.

38
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,230
And you may have seen this before. A commonly seen function.

39
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:24,520
You notice that it rises to one at u=0 and then we've got these.

40
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:32,780
We've got these terms. So one of the things we can do from that is talk about the duty cycle,

41
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:41,680
so if we define the duty cycle as to be the amount of time the signal is on compared to when it's off and then we can come up with this.

42
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:52,590
This represents eta, which we define as 2t0/T, and that's going to be a percentage that's actually.

43
00:05:52,590 --> 00:06:07,190
And if we use that normalized sinc function and the duty cycle, then we can rewrite this expression like this 2t0/T sinc(k 2t0/T).

44
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:20,540
Ck = eta sinc(k eta)

45
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,020
So one thing we might be able to do, then, is to normalize the spectral coefficient,

46
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:31,910
so if we multiply them all by T and assume t0 is fixed so the duty cycle

47
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:39,420
2t0/T will decrease as we increase T then TCk is going to be T eta sinc(k eta),

48
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:44,910
which just 2 t0 sinc(k 2t0/T).

49
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:56,750
And we can we can plot that against a normalized sinc function and we get pictures like this.

50
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:07,330
So this is a duty cycle, 50 percent. You can see that the spectra here are samples of the sinc function underneath.

51
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,230
If we increase the duty cycle, we have the same sort of range.

52
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,140
But now we've got more points.

53
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:22,120
And imagine if we were to continue to increase the duty cycle so that the width of the pulse became larger and larger and larger.

54
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,300
So the width of the pulse became narrower, narrower and narrower. As the period of the time signal got longer and longer and longer.

55
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:37,860
These these would get closer and closer and closer, and eventually we could say that we have a continuous function in omega.

56
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:44,280
So this is the intuition that leads us to the Fourier transform,

57
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:51,030
and it turns out that the sinc function is in fact the Fourier transform of the [rectangular] pulse.

58
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:59,940
So if we do the maths, then, we'll use this expression and we'll we'll use x hat(t) exp(-j k Omega0 t),

59
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:05,970
Omega0 should be capital

60
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:11,700
Omega0 is 2pi/Tz

61
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:19,500
And then we define a signal that is equal to x(t) over one period, zero elsewhere.

62
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:31,370
We can then compute this expression to come up with the Ck's.

63
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:37,310
In time domain. And if, and we know that the answer's going to come up with this because we've.

64
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:42,410
This is what we believe it will be, 2t0 sinc(t0/pi omega).

65
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:47,690
And that's going to be, these are going to be samples.

66
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:56,960
And therefore, we get this expression for x(t), in approximation the sum of these values.

67
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:13,840
And since Omega0 = 2pi/T, we can replace, simplify it down to this 1/2pi [sum] X(j k Omega0 t)

68
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:26,920
exp(j k Omega0 t) Omega0. So as we take, as T would go to the limit, then T goes to infinity, and this will essentially go to d Omega.

69
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,170
This expression, here will become the integral from minus infinity to plus infinity.

70
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:37,000
This will become, j k Omega will become a continuous function omega.

71
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:47,420
And so we'll end up with this expression. So the inverse Fourier transform is what we actually get by doing this analysis,

72
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:56,240
and it's 1/2pi integral from -infinity to +infinity X(j omega)exp(j Omega t) d omega.

73
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:06,180
And if we want to go from a function of time. Then we would use this version of it, which would be

74
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:14,340
X(j omega) = integral from -infinity to +infinity exp(-j omega t) dt, and that's called the Fourier Transform.

75
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:25,680
And you'll notice that they the two things are duals [of each other].

76
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:35,550
Some properties discussed in the notes, which are just sort of displayed to you the usual things linearity, symmetry, time,

77
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:44,610
frequency scaling, etc., the ones that you will need in the exam will be provided usually unless it's a requirement to derive them.

78
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:54,610
And there's a nice table in the notes for you to to study afterwards.

79
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:00,910
In the class, what we're going to do, we're going to work through some examples of, say,

80
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:10,450
amplitude modulation, impulse response, energy-computation, and we will do these in the classroom later on.

81
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:17,080
But the solutions to these are provided in the in the notes.

82
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:27,220
So I think that's the pre-lecture. Oh no, just a final example is to use the fouier and ifourier

83
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,410
functions very similar to the laplace and ilaplace functions that you're already familiar with.

84
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:59,300
And we're going to use these too. In the lab.

85
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:10,190
In fact, we're not going to do it in the lab. We will be using them in class, because there's not actually a lab on this, so I'll take that out.

86
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:19,250
So here's an example. So let's say we wanted to compute the Fourier transform of exp(- 0.5 t^2).

87
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:26,270
Really simple. We define some symbols t, v, omega, x.

88
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:35,720
Um, then we say ft is exp(-t^2/2) and Fw is then fourier of ft. And we use omega here

89
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:52,360
otherwise MATLAB just uses w. So let's compute that and we get the answer 2^(1/2)*pi^(1/2)*exp(-omega^2/2).

90
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:59,310
And we make that look a little bit prettier. It comes out to be the square root of 2.

91
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:05,630
times the square root of pi exp(-omega^2/2).

92
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:11,750
And we can check that that's check correct by going the other direction, and we end up with exp(-x^2/2),

93
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:26,640
which is exp(-x^2/2) where x is t, so I think we should perhaps put t in there to get the right units.

94
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:33,990
OK, so in summary, this chapter is about doing the Fourier transform.

95
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:43,900
And how it is the limit of the Fourier series. It's given you a flavour of the maths, you I wouldn't be expected to be able to reproduce such in an exam,

96
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:56,020
as you'll be pleased to hear. There are some special forms of Fourier transform, which are due to the the oddness of the signals which I haven't shown in this presentation.

97
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,110
But they are in the notes and they're worth a read.

98
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:07,180
We've looked at the properties of the transform and come up with a properties table which is familiar to you from the Laplace transform and then we've done some computations.

99
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:18,250
So that's it. And next time we'll be looking at the Fourier transform of commonly occurring signals. In the notes there are one or two worked solutions,

100
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:25,770
and I've also got some additional hand worked solutions for you

101
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:32,500
in OneNote. We're done done the solutions for you by hand.

102
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,520
So thanks for watching. This has been Chris Jobling and

103
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,011
this is the first of the two pre-lectures for week six.
