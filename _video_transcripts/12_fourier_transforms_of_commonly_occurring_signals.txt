00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:20,430
OK. Chris Jobling again, continuing week six pre-lectures, this is the second-hour pre-lecture.

2
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,550
We're going to talk about Fourier transforms of commonly occurring signals in this session.

3
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:33,640
So we're going to look at the tables of transform pairs very briefly; we'll do some examples of the computation of some of these;

4
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,020
And we'll look at the relationship between Laplace and Fourier [transforms];

5
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:44,580
And finally, we'll look at some Fourier transform of common signals that we've already seen in the Laplace context.

6
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:51,000
So the definitions. Just a reminder of the Fourier transform. We are going to change the notation slightly.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,890
So a lot of the notation I've seen omits the j omega, or the j from the j omega.

8
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:09,180
So I f(t) is function of radian frequency F(omega), the j is there, but it's not written explicitly in the transform version.

9
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:18,660
So we've got. An error in that slide, let me just correct that for us.

10
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:26,840
f(t) exp(-jomega t). Let's see if that's corrrect in the worksheet as well while we're here.

11
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,920
Yes, it's wrong there too, so we'll make that correction.

12
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:42,040
And. So that's the Fourier transform. The inverse Fourier transform is a dual of that. Notice

13
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,200
the sign of this term has changed this is F(omega) and we are integrating with respect to d omega

14
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:54,780
and we are dividing through by 2 pi because we are converting from radians to seconds.

15
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:06,570
So there is a duality between those two things, which has some important consequences when we look at Fourier transforms [not series!] and frequency manipulation generally.

16
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,230
There are some tables, lots of tables on the internet.

17
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:16,980
These are a couple linked in here, but this is the table we've, we're going to be using in this course.

18
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:29,010
I'm not sure it's come out very well in the printouts, but this is sort of a minimum set of functions that you need for, for running or computing.

19
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,440
I'll give you the most important ones, actually in lectures and in exams.

20
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:41,850
So for some selected ones, the Dirac delta is the first one, delta(t), the transform of this is one.

21
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:52,350
So if this is frequency domain, frequency, if this is time domain, [in] frequency domain is just a sort of DC in frequency for things.

22
00:02:52,350 --> 00:03:04,080
That means it's exciting every frequency, which is why you can use it for for computing the frequency response of systems [I should have said!]. In MATLAB

23
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:11,420
we would determine the Fourier transform [not series!] like this, so we use the

24
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,440
fourier function, diract(t) as you've seen before, is the delta function.

25
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:23,390
And the answer is we would expect. A related expression is is the sampling property where we have

26
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:32,090
delta(t - t0) and that's equivalent to multiplying the signal by exp(-j omega t0).

27
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:46,860
DC is a dual of this [dirac(t)], so DC and in the time domain corresponds to a delta function with height 2 pi in the frequency domain.

28
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,850
And again, we can prove this in MATLAB. So we will run this expression.

29
00:03:50,850 --> 00:04:01,290
Notice I'm defining omega here because normally MATLAB just uses w. So if I add no variable then you see it would give you back w.

30
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,570
But we've been using omega, and  I think I prefer to see omega,

31
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:15,660
So that's the reason why we've got a second argument there. Again, this is related to this frequency shifting property.

32
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:25,560
So exp(j omega0 t) is the same as 2pi delta(omega - omega0) in the frequency domain.

33
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:34,530
If we have a cosine, a sinewave with even symmetry, then by Euler's relationship get this expression and from the previous result,

34
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,970
1/2 exp(j omega0 t) becomes pi delta(omega - omega0) and 1/2 exp(j omega0 t)

35
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:45,690
becomes delta(omega + omega0). So a cosine wave

36
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:55,280
becomes two real values in the frequency domain centred at -omega0 and +omega0.

37
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:07,190
And since f(t) is real, and even so, is f(omega). Ths sine wave has this function 1/(j2)(exp(j omega0 t) - exp(-j omega0 t)) and that

38
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:12,860
comes out out as -j pi delta(omega - omega0) and j pi delta(omega + omega0).

39
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:19,730
So the sine wave becomes this expression,

40
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:28,520
where this is the imaginary part of the frequency response, notice, and the height is is pi at omega0 and -pi at -omega0,

41
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:36,080
f(t) is real and odd, F(omega) imaginary and odd. And the relationship between real and imaginary and so on,

42
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,770
they're explained in some of the properties [of the Fourier transform] discussed in the previous lecture, which we didn't actually cover in the video.

43
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:51,500
So you might need to read the notes to find out more. The signum function, sign function as we call it,

44
00:05:51,500 --> 00:06:04,520
is defined like this signum(x) is equal to -1 if x < 0; is zero if x = 0;  +1 if x > 0.

45
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:15,380
And the transform of this function is u0(t) - u0(-t), which comes out to be 2/(j omega).

46
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:22,310
And we often use this kind of circuit as a voltage comparator in circuit theory circuits.

47
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:33,830
And from that, we can get to the unit step because the signum function can be used to define what the transform of u0(t) will be.

48
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,730
It comes out to be pi delta(omega) + 1/(j omega).

49
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:45,080
and we get to it by using this relationship sign(t) 2 u0(t) - 1, which is illustrated here.

50
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:57,770
This is 2 u0(t) and if you take away one, this will shift down and we'll end up with the unit step.

51
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,850
So from that, we get this expression.

52
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:12,240
So the DC value gives us this delta term and half of the signum function gives us this 1/(jomega) term. 

53
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:20,500
So using those results it is relatively easy to show these properties, which we will look at in the class, so exp(j omega0 t) 

54
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:28,620
u0(t) is pi delta(omega - omega0) + 1/(j(omega - omgeg0)).

55
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:34,860
We can also show that sin(omega0 t) u0(t) is given by this expression,

56
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:43,020
and we can use that result  to compute the cos version, which comes out to be this.

57
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:50,250
So we'll do those examples in class. It is also possible to get the Fourier transform from the Laplace transform.

58
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:57,720
So if you've got a function of time, which is 0 for t less than or equal to 0, we can obtain the Fourier transform by substituting s by  j omega.

59
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,090
So as an example of that,

60
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:08,590
given that the Laplace transform of exp(-at) u0(t) is 1 /(s + a), Fourier transform of exp(-a t)

61
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:20,640
u0(t) and I'm just going to make this, into a, tidy this up a wee bit. That should be a fragment

62
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:38,490
I think. So we we can do the computation in class, but it comes out to be the answer is one over....

63
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:47,670
I didn't want a fragment, I wanted a sub-slide. Sorry! Sorry for the slight delay.

64
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,190
So the answer is this. 1/(j omega + a).

65
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:59,740
Well, that's easy to prove. And we'll show that. And similarly for this one.

66
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:07,170
We can easily show the answer is this.

67
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:15,810
So that's always a useful trick if you know you're dealing with real time functions where the values are zero, before t = 0.

68
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:22,290
You can make that substitution and convert very easily from the Laplace Fourier. In class.

69
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:31,380
we'll look at some other common signals, like the rectangle pulse, the triangular pulse, periodic time function, unit pulse train.

70
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:38,070
But there are also some worked solutions if we don't get through them all on the OneNote.

71
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:45,330
And there are some suggestions for further reading for other interesting things about the Fourier transform,

72
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:53,610
particularly in the book by Boulet rather than Karris. And so I'll leave you to look at those in your own time.

73
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:59,580
So as a brief summary of this pre-lecture, then. We've looked at the tables.

74
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:05,280
We've shown you some examples and the relationship between the Laplace and Fourier [transforms] and we'll

75
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,500
be computing some for each some of the common signals in the classroom.

76
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:19,830
So we'll see you there. And then in the next week, week seven, we'll look at Fourier transforms for LTI systems and circuit analysis.

77
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:26,700
And we'll follow that with a look at using Fourier transforms for the design of continuous time filters.

78
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,677
So thanks for watching. See you soon. Bye.
