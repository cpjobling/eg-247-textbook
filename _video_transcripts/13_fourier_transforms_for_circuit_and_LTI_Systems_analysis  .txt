Hi, this is Chris Jobling. And this is the pre recorded lecture for week seven, the first hour: Fourier transforms three.

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:16,440
And today we're going to look at Fourier transforms for circuits and LTI systems analysis.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:25,500
So the background reading for this, as before, is Chapter eight of Karris and also Chapter five of Boulet,

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:32,640
both of which are linked into the Canvas site and into the OneNote classroom notebook so you can follow along if you wish.

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,050
This is what I intend to cover in this first session.

6
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:44,080
We'll talk about the system function, then give some examples and we'll do the examples in class as before.

7
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:53,310
And so let's look at the system function, which is equivalent, in a sense, to the transfer function used for Laplace transforms.

8
00:00:53,310 --> 00:01:00,120
So if we consider what we get, if we do a system response from a system impulse response,

9
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,160
the impulse response essentially defines the dynamics of a system.

10
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:14,280
So from the convolution integral with, if we have a system with an impulse response of h(t), an input of u(t),

11
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:21,870
then the convolution is equal to this integral minus infinity to infinity of h(t - tau) u(tau).

12
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:31,290
With respect to d tau, we've seen that before. Um, and if we let g(t) equal that, uh, convolution integral,

13
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:38,220
then by the time convolutional property, um, the convolution of h(t) g(t) is equal to g(t),

14
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:45,960
which is equal to G(omega) or G(j omega) with, uh, which is going to be the product of H(omega) and U(omega).

15
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:53,580
Were H(omega) and U(omega) are the Fourier transforms of the respective system and signal.

16
00:01:53,580 --> 00:02:06,360
So we define this, uh, this expression that defines the system response H(omega), we call that the system function in frequency domain terms.

17
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,170
And we note that the system function and the impulse response h(t) form the Fourier transform

18
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:20,140
pair h(t) and the Fourier transform H(omega) is the inverse Fourier transform into h(t).

19
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:27,040
So obtaining system response, if we know the impulse response h(t), we can compute the system response g(t)

20
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:34,600
for any input u(t) have to by multiplying the Fourier transform of H(omega) and U(omega) to obtain G(omega).

21
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,830
And then we take the inverse Fourier transform of G(omega) to obtain the response g(t).

22
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:49,050
Um, so it's very similar to what we do for Laplace transforms and the the procedures are very, very, very, very similar indeed.

23
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:55,360
So in the examples, we'll do a number of these, um, for example, example one.

24
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,240
Um, we'll look at this linear network, which has this impulse response exponential.

25
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:07,590
And we'll consider what happens if we put a pulse into that. A pulse which starts at zero and ends at three.

26
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:17,850
That's that's the first example we'll do in class. Uh, and then we will do MATLAB verification just to prove that.

27
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:24,690
Um, and then the second example we'll do is this simple RL circuit,

28
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:31,190
which again is very similar to try to transfer a function impulse response of around 5 exp(-3t).

29
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:40,400
Again, we'll do the MATLAB verification in class. And on the third example will be to look at, uh,

30
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:48,530
a differential equation where the input voltage is an exponential we'll use the Fourier transform method to compute the output,

31
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:57,420
and again, we'll verify the result in MATLAB.

32
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:13,670
And finally, will we look at the energy in a resistor subjected to this signal here using Parseval's thereom?

33
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:20,540
So all those examples were doing class, and that will be the the, uh, first session on Monday.

34
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,384
So we'll see you then. Thanks for watching.
