00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:07,380
Hi, Chris Jobling again. And this is again for week seven, this is the second hour where we'll be talking about filters.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,430
And this will conclude our discussion of Fourier transforms.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:22,800
So, uh, in this in this session again, the uh, reading its, most of the reading actually comes from Boulet for this particular section.

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:34,200
But you will find a extensive chapter on filters in in Chapter 11 of Karris, um, with more than I'm able to cover in the course of this lecture.

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:42,800
So if you want to find out more about filters, um, analogue filters in particular, uh, that's a very good place to start.

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:50,930
So in this session, we're going to introduce the idea of a frequency selective filter and then talk about an ideal low pass filter.

7
00:00:50,930 --> 00:01:03,320
And finally going to talk about Butterworth low-pass filters and we will leave the discovery of other types of filters, Chebyshev etc. to you to find out more about them.

8
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:14,190
We'll also look at high-pass filters, band-pass filters and possibilities and uh, and conclude with with a few remarks.

9
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,790
So filter design is a very important application for the Fourier transform because we're

10
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:23,850
dealing essentially with changing the frequency response of a system or signal.

11
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,720
Uh, it's a very rich topic often taught in in the course of a whole course or module.

12
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,270
So we'll only give an introduction in this session.

13
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:44,270
Um, but we will illustrate the usefulness of frequency domain viewpoint, and we will show how the filters can shape the spectrum of the signal.

14
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,440
So a frequency selective filter then is an ideal filter.

15
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:58,010
It's a system that lets the frequency components of a signal through undistorted while components at other frequencies are completely cut off.

16
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:09,940
Let me correct that slide because uh, that's not exactly.

17
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:29,200
True. I should say frequency components, I think.

18
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:37,750
Frequency components of [inaudible]  So the range of frequencies are let through belong to what's called the pass-band

19
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,790
frequencies, and the range of frequencies cut off by the filter called the stop-band.

20
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:48,370
And the typical scenario where filtering is needed is when we've got some noise added to a signal.

21
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,860
But the signal has most of its energy outside the bandwidth of the signal. So let's have a look.

22
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:59,080
That type of problem is illustrated by this block diagram. Here we have a system represents the filter,

23
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:09,100
we have a signal and in that signal we've added some noise and these both these have got frequencies or frequency components,

24
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,510
and the filter is here to remove essentially the noise so, and produce,

25
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,470
and return back the measurement of the original signal.

26
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:25,220
So let's see how that might actually work. So in frequency domain, this this is a representation of what the signal looks like.

27
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:33,400
Yeah, it's a rather idealised signal, I guess, but it's because it's got a bandwidth from -W to +W in the omega domain.

28
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,550
And this represents the signal X(omega), the frequency response of the signal.

29
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,150
Um, let's assume we've got some out of bandwidth noise.

30
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:51,190
So here are plus or minus W before you can see we have this element of frequency here, which are outside that range.

31
00:03:51,190 --> 00:04:00,180
So if we add the signal to the noise, we will get this kind of arrangement.

32
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:09,870
So what we want to do is we want to use some kind of filter to take this signal [with noise added] and return this signal, which is our original signal.

33
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,620
And so we might imagine if we could, if we it was possible,

34
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:20,790
we could have this ideal sort of rectangular filter here where the bandwidth was -W to +W

35
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,570
and everything in that range you just passed through unchanged with everything outside

36
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:40,380
That range is, uh, is cut off. It's a little bit like what we do with the step function when we're trying to synthesise signals in time.

37
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:49,440
And there's a motivating example, if you go to Canvas,

38
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,860
and I'll just take you, that was just to illustrate what I mean.

39
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:09,100
We have this little video where my colleague from, uh, from an Irish University takes us through filtering and shows how we can design filters.

40
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,800
And there's a script that goes along with that so that he might be worth watching that video when you get to when they get a minute,

41
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:25,420
because that's quite useful. Um, illustration of a filter that gives you a more, uh, feeling of what what I'm talking about here.

42
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,860
So an ideal low-pass filter would be the one like one you just saw where we have,

43
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:37,690
uh, this system Hlp(omega), which is equal to one for omega less than

44
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:48,980
a cut-off frequency omega_c or zero for any frequency outside that range.

45
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,560
That's what the response would look like, we've already seen the signal, in the example we showed you before,

46
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,410
an an ideal low-pass filter would be this rectangular filter. Notice the gain of this filter is 1

47
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:08,040
so it just passes through signals. Any, any frequencies in this range will be passed through unchanged.

48
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,990
The impulse response of that filter because is easy to compute,

49
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,540
but because of the mirroring effect of the Fourier transform and the inverse Fourier transform

50
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:25,210
it comes out to be a sinc function, a (sin(x))/x type function.

51
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,440
And that's what it looks like. So this is time domain now.

52
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,540
This is what the time response, the impulse response of that filter would have to look like.

53
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:41,290
To give you that rectangular, ideal rectangular frequency response.

54
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:49,640
Because filtering is convolution, the output of the system with that impulse response is going to be subject to this.

55
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:59,970
But with let me just close this. 

56
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:05,280
The favourites bar and give it more space?

57
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:17,770
On the UH? So gone, gone.

58
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:24,610
Well, not much more space, but you can see that we've got this impulse response subject the input signal.

59
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,930
So convolution is just a product of those two signals.

60
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:35,740
So probably the ideal filter is that this is what step response looks like, and you can see it's not causal.

61
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,990
There are elements in this time response which occur before zero time.

62
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:46,720
So clearly this is not a filter we can actually implement in reality. Um.

63
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:57,040
And so we need to look for alternatives, and the, one of the easiest alternatives to use is what's called a Butterworth filter,

64
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,050
which is  Nth-order filter with this kind of transfer function.

65
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,650
1/(1 + (omega/omega_c)^(2N))).

66
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:15,490
To the power of a half. So this represents the frequency response or at least the absolute value of the frequency

67
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:24,760
response for a Butterworth filter and N can be 1, 2, 3 4, any number you like.

68
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:31,630
And the more, obviously, the more and you have, the more poles you will have in the system and the more complicated the filter will be.

69
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:36,250
But they all have, um, specific properties.

70
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,770
The first property is that the DC gain is one. At zero frequency,

71
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,520
The gain is one. At the cut-off frequency,

72
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:57,910
The gain is always 1/sqrt(2) for any value of N which is -3 dB in sort of standard measure.

73
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:07,510
And they have a particular roll off, which is equal to 20 x N decibels per decade.

74
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:17,890
So as an example, this is the second-order Butterworth filter. Um, if we put the numbers in, this is what the transfer function characteristic equation would be.

75
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,720
s^2 + omgega_c*sqrt(2)*s + omega)c^2 = 0 

76
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:31,400
And the poles of that have properties, which we will explore as an example in the class.

77
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:41,960
Example six we will derive the differential equation for that filter.

78
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:54,030
Example seven we will determine its frequency response. And we'll compute it's values with MATLAB, and then in Example

79
00:09:54,030 --> 00:10:06,470
eight we'll try and determine the impulse and step response of a Butterworth filter.

80
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:14,930
And we will find that transform pair useful and having done those examples,

81
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:20,110
we will go on to talk about high-pass filters and band-pass filters.

82
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:28,730
So a high-pass filter is a filter where we basically change, change the limits around in the in the centrer region.

83
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:35,330
We have a gain of zero, with frequencies above the cut-off frequency of have a gain of one.

84
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:42,090
So that's the filter response that looks like this.

85
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:52,430
And we can obtain those very straightforwardly the frequency response is simply one minus the low-pass filter response.

86
00:10:52,430 --> 00:11:01,830
Well, the same with the same cut-off frequency. Impulse response is going to be delta(t) minus the impulse response of the low pass filter.

87
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:08,340
And so we will, if we have time we'll look at an example of that and its magnitude frequency response,

88
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:16,210
etc. The band-pass filter is one for which we limit the range for which the filter

89
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:23,580
filter passes through what changed between a cut-off frequency one and two.

90
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:34,450
So that's the sort of filter we're looking at. So I need to change the uh.

91
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:42,380
a bit because we're not getting this picture. So let me just correct that.

92
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:51,570
Go back here and start the presentation again. So we want we want a filter response that looks like this.

93
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:58,370
You can see that in this region where passing filters below that frequency, you can see one of cutting things off and above,

94
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:06,810
but cutting things off, remember, and the frequency response you always have the negative and the positive frequencies.

95
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:13,300
Uh, we've got one of these by multiplying a low pass filter with the cut-off frequency.

96
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:20,380
omega_c1 with the high-pass with a frequency of omega_c2.

97
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:38,180
I think the other way around. So that's our summary, that's how we use frequency selective filters, looked at the ideal low-pass, 

98
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:47,810
Butterworth, high-pass and band-pass, and as I said, we will look at a few examples in class, including some MATLAB calculations.

99
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:55,640
And then next we will start looking at sampling theory.

100
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,840
So thanks for the attention and I'll see you on Monday. Thanks very much.
