00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:07,380
Hi, Chris Jobling again. And this is again for week seven, this is the second hour where we'll be talking about filters.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,430
And this would conclude our discussion of air transport.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:22,800
So, uh, in this in this session again, the uh, reading this, most of the reading actually comes from Google for this particular section.

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:34,200
But you will find a extensive chapter on filters in in Chapter 11 of Carris, um, with more than I'm able to cover in the course of this lecture.

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:42,800
So if you want to find out more about filters, um, analogue filters in particular, uh, that's a very good place to start.

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:50,930
So in this session, we're going to introduce the idea of a frequency selective filter and then talk about an ideal low pass filter.

7
00:00:50,930 --> 00:01:03,320
I'm finally going to talk about what the possibilities and leave the discovery of other types of filters, etc. to you to find out more about them.

8
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:14,190
We'll also look at past filters and possibilities and uh, and conclude with with a few remarks.

9
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,790
So it felt design very important application for her to transform because we're

10
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:23,850
dealing essentially with changing the frequency response of a system or signal.

11
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,720
Uh, it's a very rich topic often taught in in the course of a whole course or module.

12
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,270
So we're only give an instruction in this session.

13
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:44,270
Um, but we will illustrate the usefulness of frequency, the viewpoint, and we will show how the filters can shape the spectrum of the signal.

14
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,440
So I frequently like a filter, then is an ideal filter.

15
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:58,010
It's a system that lets the frequency components of a signal through undistorted while components at other other frequencies are completely cut off.

16
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:09,940
Let me correct that slide because uh, that's not exactly.

17
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:29,200
True. I should say frequency components, I think.

18
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:37,750
Frequency components of the compound, right? So the range of frequencies are let through belong to what's called the pass band

19
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,790
frequencies and the range of frequencies cut off by the filter called the stop band.

20
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:48,370
And the typical scenario where filtering is needed is when we've got some noise added to a signal.

21
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,860
But the signal has most of its energy outside the bandwidth of the signal. So let's have a look.

22
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:59,080
That type of problem is illustrated by this block diagram. Here we have a system represents the filter,

23
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:09,100
we have a signal and then not I'm not saying we've added some noise and these both these I've got frequencies or frequency components,

24
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,510
and the filter is here to remove essentially the noise source and produce.

25
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,470
But we turn back the measurement of the original signal.

26
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:25,220
So let's see how that might actually work. So in frequency domain, this this is a representation of what the signal looks like.

27
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:33,400
Yeah, it's a rather idealised signal, I guess, but it's because he's got a bandwidth from minus eight plus W in the omega domain.

28
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,550
And this represents the signal x oh my God, the frequency response of the signal.

29
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,150
Um, let's assume we've got some out of bandwidth noise.

30
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:51,190
So here are plus or minus W before you can see we have this element of frequency here, which are outside that range.

31
00:03:51,190 --> 00:04:00,180
So if we add the signal to the noise, we will get this kind of arrangement.

32
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:09,870
So what we want to do is we want to use some kind of filter to take this sick signal and produce return the signal, which is our original signal.

33
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,620
And so we might imagine if we could, if we it was possible,

34
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:20,790
we could have this ideal sort of rectangular filter here where the bandwidth was minus omega

35
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,570
and everything in that range you just passed through and changed with everything outside.

36
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:40,380
That range is, uh, is cut off. It's a little bit like what we do with the step two step function when we're trying to synthesise signals in time.

37
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:49,440
And there's a motivating example, if you go to the OneNote classroom notebook or a blackboard,

38
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,860
and I'll just take you, that was just to illustrate what I mean.

39
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:09,100
We have this little video where my colleague from, uh, from the Irish University takes us through filtering and shows how we can design filters.

40
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,800
And there's a script that goes along with that so that he might be worth watching that video when you get to when they get a minute,

41
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:25,420
because that's quite useful. Um, illustration of a filter that gives you a more, uh, feeling of what what I'm talking about here.

42
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,860
So an ideal felt low pass filter would be the one like one you just saw where we have,

43
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:37,690
uh, this system HP Omega, which is equal to one for omega lesson.

44
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:48,980
I got a frequency. I'll make a c um o zero for any frequency outside that range.

45
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,560
That's what the response would look like, Dorothy Signal, in the example we showed you before,

46
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,410
and I did a profile to work with this rectangular filter. Notice the gain of this filter as well.

47
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:08,040
So it just passes through signals. Any, any any frequencies in this range will be passed through and changed.

48
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,990
The impulse response of that filter because of the it's easy to compute,

49
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,540
but because of the um mirroring effect of the euphoria transforming the universe for in principle,

50
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:25,210
it comes out to be, I think, one sign that Kovrig's like function.

51
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,440
And that's what it looks like. So this is time domain now.

52
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,540
This is what the time response, the impulse response of that filter would have to look like.

53
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:41,290
To give you that rectangular, ideal rectangular frequency response.

54
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:49,640
Because filtering is convolution, the input, the output of the system with the input response is going to be subject to this.

55
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:59,970
But with let me just close this. Hillary Clinton.

56
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:05,280
What was the, uh, favourite spot and give it more space?

57
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:17,770
On the UH? So gone, gone.

58
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:24,610
Well, not much more space, but you can see that we've got this impulse response subject the input signal.

59
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,930
So convolution is just a product of those two signals.

60
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:35,740
So probably the ideal filter is that this is what the response looks like, and you can see it's not causal.

61
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,990
There are elements in this term response which occur before zero time.

62
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:46,720
So clearly this is not a filter we can actually implement in reality. Um.

63
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:57,040
And so we need to look for alternatives, and the one of the easiest alternatives to use is what's called a bottle with filter,

64
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,050
which is an order filter with this kind of transfer function.

65
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,650
One over one plus omega of omega three, the power of two.

66
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:15,490
And that's the power of a half. So this represents the frequency response or at least the absolute value of the frequency

67
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:24,760
response for fibre to a filter and and can be one to three for any number you like.

68
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:31,630
And the more obviously, the more and you have, the more poles you will have in the system and the more complicated the filter will be.

69
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:36,250
But they all have, um, specific properties.

70
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,770
Both properties that the DC gain is one that's not zero frequency.

71
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,520
The gain is one of the cut-off frequency.

72
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:57,910
The gain is always one over to one of the square root of two for any value and which is minus three decimals in the mean sort of standard measure.

73
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:07,510
And they have a particular role off, which is equal to 20 times and times talked about per decade.

74
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:17,890
So as an example, this is the second Liberal Party with Filter. Um, if we put the numbers in, this is what the transfer function equation would be.

75
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,720
That's where it omega seat to as policymakers c squared.

76
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:31,400
And the polls of that um of seven properties, which we will explore as an example in the class.

77
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:41,960
Example six will will derive the differential equation for that filter.

78
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:54,030
Example seven will determine its frequency response. And we'll find complete competing values with MATLAB, and then an example,

79
00:09:54,030 --> 00:10:06,470
eight will try and determine the important step response of a portable thought that would get rid of that.

80
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:14,930
And we will find that transfer of power from the private useful and will include those examples,

81
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:20,110
we will go on to talk about IPOs, filters and possibilities.

82
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:28,730
So I passed Filter the filter where we basically change, change the limits around in the in the central region.

83
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:35,330
We have a gain of zero in the air with frequencies above the cut-off frequency of have a gain of one.

84
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:42,090
So that's the filter response that looks like this.

85
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:52,430
And we can obtain those very straightforwardly the frequency response is simply one minus the low pass filter response.

86
00:10:52,430 --> 00:11:01,830
Well, the same with the same cut-off frequency. Impulse response is going to be Delta T minus the input response, the low pass filter.

87
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:08,340
And so will we have time we'll look at an example of that and its magnitude, frequency response,

88
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:16,210
etc. The Band Pass filter is one for which we limit the range for which the filter

89
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:23,580
filter passes through what changed between a cut-off frequency one and two.

90
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:34,450
So that's the sort of filter we're looking at. So I need to change the uh.

91
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:42,380
Have peace because we're not getting this picture of a fragmented needs to be supplied, so let me just correct that.

92
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:51,570
Go back here and start the presentation again. So we want we want a filter response that looks like this.

93
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:58,370
You can see that in this region where passing filters below that frequency, you can see one of cutting things off and above,

94
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:06,810
but cutting things off, remember, and the frequency response you always have the negative and the positive frequencies.

95
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:13,300
Uh, we've got one of these by multiplying a low pass filter with the cut-off frequency.

96
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:20,380
I'll I'll make a C one with the iPod filter with a frequency of moxie.

97
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:38,180
I think the other way around. So that's very summery, that's our use frequencies that it filters up to the I look at the low parts,

98
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:47,810
but with high patterned bumpers, and as I said, we will look at a few examples in class, including some MATLAB or calibrations.

99
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:55,640
And then after Easter, when we get back from the from the break, we will start looking at sampling theory.

100
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,840
So thanks for the attention and I'll see you on Monday. Thanks very much.
