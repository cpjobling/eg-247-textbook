00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,960
Hi, this is Chris Jobling making a pre-lecture recording of what we're going to talk about on Monday

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:16,470
about sampling systems. And so hopefully you'll be able to watch this before the lecture so that we can concentrate

3
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:26,280
more on doing some of the examples and demonstrating to some of the some of the MATLAB in the session itself.

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:34,050
So this is a background reading. I've taken the notes essentially from Ben book format of signals and systems,

5
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,580
from the recommended reading lists of the books that you can read online.

6
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:46,980
And I've used Chapter 15 of that, but you'll also find a little bit in Chapter nine as Congress just putting some of it.

7
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,820
So when you've got the background details? You couldn't go quick pretty quickly through this.

8
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:00,660
This is the agenda for the session. We're going to start by talking about sampling of continuous time surveillance and

9
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,540
how you want to deal with samples of these historic signals from from sample data.

10
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,220
And I want to say a little bit about discrete time processing the continuous time signals,

11
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,620
which is essentially the computational part of all of this topic.

12
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:28,100
And then we're going to talk about how we might sample discrete time systems, perhaps to change something from.

13
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:37,730
We're going to be a demonstration in the lecture and just as an acknowledgement, but try to use it, the scripts that I'm going to be using,

14
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:46,370
some have been adapted from some code that was made available by Professor, both of the university.

15
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:51,980
So this course digital signal processing. So we'll be using that to illustrate something.

16
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,770
And in this?

17
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:06,930
So as an introduction, just to tell you that something provides a bridge between continuous time or safety and discrete time signals on systems,

18
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:13,220
so sampling records discrete values of a continuous turn signal of periodic instances time.

19
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,250
So typically the sort of thing that we are interested in,

20
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:25,290
we can see with something is regular and predictable and as every few seconds of milliseconds.

21
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:32,010
And we can then take that data which has been sampled and it can essentially be stored in the file.

22
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,230
If you like or put in some memory in a computer and then it can be used for real time or off-line processing.

23
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:46,800
So you can, you can. You can envisage signals which do that sampling and data manipulation within real time as it happens.

24
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,640
So think about doing the mobile phone example to record some audio or video,

25
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,770
or you could store some data for offline processing and go back to it later and press.

26
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:05,520
So photography is an example of this when you take a picture and when you go into Photoshop or something and make a picture of it in.

27
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,270
By sampling basically every possible, the process of the type signals from various filters,

28
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:15,530
typically finer impulse response, as I say, just an inflated response.

29
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:22,070
Air filters in this course, we don't have time to pursue these very far.

30
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:29,650
But it's worth mentioning that that's so that spectrum. You know, once you've got some persistent and then in.

31
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:36,050
Infiltrated the change agents that we've got in his footprints.

32
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:44,090
In the lecture, we're going to ask for volunteers, and I'm going to basically use a script to sample that volunteers voice.

33
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:51,200
We'll play it back and we've got the data. And then later on in this session, we'll look at alias and not send data.

34
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,550
But since since this a pre-election, we won't do that and then we'll do that in class.

35
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:04,080
But having having done that, we will get a sample to six.

36
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,440
Second, we really want to explain sort of mathematically, you know, technically what's going on in something.

37
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:16,940
So let's let's use slides, just talk about what's going on in some kind of continuous time signals what's going on.

38
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,440
So in the time domain,

39
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:32,300
what we have is essentially we have a continuous time signal emerging that's next to you and that's being passed through this list.

40
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,530
Multiply it here.

41
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:44,000
One of the inputs is considered to be a chain of impulses, each one separated by a integer multiple onto something time, which is two.

42
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:54,830
Yes. In this example. So by taking this sample, multiply it by this modulating function, we get this.

43
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:05,850
Response. For the dotted line is the original signal, but the actual output of this operation is these impulses were shown here,

44
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:12,830
the heights representing the value of this, the signal that the point at which it is sampled by the impulse.

45
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:17,690
And one of the impulse operators was this something property to basically take

46
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:23,240
citizens signal in terms of our you think something as the as at the time and to us?

47
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,610
So we've got zero two, yes, wanting us to take us through this process and so on.

48
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,980
And you can see that. But in mathematical terms, the heights, it's not really a height.

49
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:45,750
It's the area of the impulse which is equal to the value of the signal output at the top of something.

50
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,190
So in the frequency domain, what we get is we get this.

51
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:56,970
Let's assume this, we will survive this kind of spectrum. A simple spectrum just for research purposes.

52
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:02,340
And it's band limited between minus omega and plus komakam.

53
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,790
And then what's the connexion in the time domain is convolution in the frequency domain.

54
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:15,030
So what we're doing is we're basically putting you through a combination operator,

55
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:21,840
and the alphabet is one of two PI, which is a combination of the police response impulse.

56
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,190
And that gives us this results hexadecimal one two.

57
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:32,580
Yes, it's time to some of ex over there, but in this case, yes.

58
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:39,690
And so the omega arrest is a sampling frequency. So what you're getting is a set of spectra sputters,

59
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:50,370
but a set of frequency responses repeating themselves every multiple of something frequency, no duress.

60
00:06:50,370 --> 00:07:02,370
So we get the original signal here scaled by one of the tests and then the other a reflection of that a minus omega reflector plus on the.

61
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,080
And then we have got to make arrests and over here minus two in the U.S. and so on.

62
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,820
So free this this spectrum will be repeated over and over again.

63
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:24,600
Basically infinity theoretically, at least with every all the spectrum repeating itself around frequency multiples of the sampling frequency.

64
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:30,840
So here we have the original signal coming in. This is its representations that we would describe it.

65
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:38,970
The two PI here comes in because of the the flow of the transform of the delta function.

66
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:46,290
And because of the. You have a function to say yes, because the.

67
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:52,510
And this is the result you get, so you basically get this frequency response.

68
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,840
I think I show during one of the early lectures.

69
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:04,230
Similarly, when we have a sequence of impulses, we get the sequence of impulses in the sequence of the many separation from the centre frequency.

70
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:10,460
So this is this is essentially what happens when you do something.

71
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:16,160
So mathematical terms, what's going on here is we were basically constructing this function of time,

72
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:26,870
which is the sum of all about Australia's sample, that this frequency, we're converting that in the frequency domain by using convolution.

73
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,080
So convolution tells me we will divide by one of two.

74
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:38,090
Yes, we convert X to ascend to X the X new in this case.

75
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:47,930
And then we've got this Delta T minus you're going going on and then by the sampling property, this reduces to this.

76
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,940
So basically, the next term becomes only the minus came with this.

77
00:08:52,940 --> 00:09:01,070
And then by the second property, we get rid of the integral from the independent of the summation of frequencies,

78
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:09,660
each one of them separated by the solids with a certain frequency.

79
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:22,850
That leads us on to something that we're sampling theorem. And I did not show you sign, but if you go back a couple of slides to the picture,

80
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:32,810
what you should notice here is because of these, these caps, we basically got a value range here.

81
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:40,280
So the limited original signal was a range of gas minus one lying around to omega and also again.

82
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:46,220
And in this particular case, you can see those clearly differentiated the gap between the next one.

83
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:53,990
And so we can recover that signal and we'll see later if we can't guarantee that it was unlimited in this way.

84
00:09:53,990 --> 00:10:02,850
Then you get overlap, and that causes some problems. Because they say it will come back to that to connect to the people's time.

85
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:09,870
So my question and some consider and basically tells us that if we have a son connected to time,

86
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:18,390
seemingly someplace using this something time to guess and is an integer, then we can recover the original signal.

87
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:32,140
If Omega X is greater than twice the the bandwidth of the original signal price only ground.

88
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:38,290
You know, my dress is 2.2, yes, which is a certain frequency.

89
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:48,530
So as an example of that, imagine that we had an ideal low pass filter which had this spectacular process

90
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:52,520
and the cut off frequency would minus omega wrestling to pull something,

91
00:10:52,520 --> 00:11:01,750
I guess, or to providing that. But the end points of this are in the gap between the four bands in something domain.

92
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:06,850
Then we will be able to get this filter back and if we multiply that filter by two, yes.

93
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:16,780
So we have a bit of gain in this, we will basically try this one over to us by yes and get lucky with this signal.

94
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:27,810
So. You can imagine it all only, although the ghost bands, if you like side buttons, get by the.

95
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:35,190
So. Okay, so theoretically, if we had a low pass filter, was this getting to us?

96
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:44,230
And I do a little cross filter with this cut of three percent or less of the two than then we feed our sample signal, get the bottom of this.

97
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:52,310
Of course, this is set. Have otherwise you couldn't approximate.

98
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:59,450
Well, the real thing we use is a sample of Hold Operator, which is roughly illustrated by this.

99
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,430
So here we are actually going to have input voltage switch and a capacitor, of course,

100
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,630
the switch to press charges and basically holds up the volume on the switch.

101
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:15,800
But close it opens again close along with the voltage for no time in that zone.

102
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:26,000
So we can take in pulse and we can reproduce a sort of continuous square wave Typekit response because they're on hold.

103
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,180
And this is that kind of circuitry.

104
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:40,180
So this is typically we model, but it's done well, and I look at this look better using this kind of representation.

105
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:51,160
And it turns out that the so-called operator is equivalent to the impulse of a way of getting back the data that we need for consumption.

106
00:12:51,160 --> 00:13:01,690
The. We'll do an example in the lecture showing showing you this something operating within more detail.

107
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:06,820
But what we're going to go to now is talk about signal reconstruction.

108
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:20,670
So we have this pandemic to signal and sampled at the local Samsung apps like that question, something that frequently goes on to point out to us.

109
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:27,360
And reserve for other districts, time signal, for which we want to be distributing the signal, so we get back to these lots.

110
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,850
Well, how do we model if you like the digital to unlock conversion?

111
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:42,320
If we were to use that perfect low pass filter, then we would be using.

112
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,240
And the sink function, basically,

113
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:55,340
because the tide response was a rectangle function in the frequency response is if the sink function saw this and further transform lecture.

114
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:07,630
So that's in the demonstrate that there's few boats in which it's we should spend a little bit further.

115
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:12,840
We'll look at the scene in the lecture.

116
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:23,230
I will also look at it and say with the hope of the first one, I hope something as well as some reconstruction using those filters as well.

117
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:28,520
And the next topic will cover this in the pre is is aliasing.

118
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:36,920
The plural hinted at this when we showed the spectrum where the nice gaps between the little triangles in the frequency domain.

119
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:43,460
That was fine. But of course, if we can't guarantee that we have this gap,

120
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:50,210
then we're going to get what's called a so we can't recover the original signal by a low pass filter, in other words.

121
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:58,100
This is illustrated in this slide. Let's assume we have something such that we don't quite meet the shunning theorem.

122
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:04,070
Then what you're going to get is overlap between the spectrum. But then in this region here,

123
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:15,930
you really have no way of reconstructing the frequencies and that's we're going to get some kind of distortion in the signal response.

124
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:22,190
So we will illustrate this in the in the lab by using.

125
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:42,710
The script to a single recorded start. But we will go on to talk about anti-aliasing filters, so we make these filters and do lots of basic,

126
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:52,880
what we need to do is we need to pre process the visual signal so that it is limited such that we can recover it.

127
00:15:52,880 --> 00:16:00,440
It's not a perfect solution because we can't have perfect filters and images of the lack of atmosphere or something like that.

128
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:06,140
And of course, they're not going to be some distortions of things that come in.

129
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:15,320
But these occur typically high frequencies, and we can ignore them because some things like audio, we can't hear them for one thing,

130
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:24,080
but we can sort of ignore those because the distortion we get, I think, is in much less of a problem than the distortion.

131
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:36,500
We get a low frequencies because of the ABC. So that's something we will talk about, and some will have examples of that.

132
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:49,380
And then finally, we'll have a practical application, digital audio, and we'll talk about digital audio and basically the idea that if we.

133
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:55,700
For for such seedy quality, as we call it, a $9 million a year.

134
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:06,090
But we can hear of sounds about 20 kilohertz as human beings, but set the limits of the best possible, best here can hear.

135
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:15,280
So we typically battle an entire city about 20 kilohertz recording audio good quality sound for music playback.

136
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:26,080
So for phones and things, much, much lower frequency than what you can get in the same four kilohertz recorded voice, you know,

137
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:35,080
somebody should probably spam with the telephone calls much less than it is for transmitting music, high quality music.

138
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,560
Anyway, we're going to have to as a filter.

139
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:47,450
We typically sample that at forty four point one kilohertz and therefore we're going to be announcing that his thoughts are with around 22 kilohertz.

140
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:54,580
So to satisfy that requirement, I have to ask an example question on this.

141
00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:02,560
So it'll be worth thinking about what the what the implications are of this in the.

142
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,040
So the homework section. Finally,

143
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,990
I think in this pre-election just want to talk a little bit about the sort of pipeline

144
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:16,130
and this is how we do digital time processing will continue as planned signals.

145
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:21,530
We typically have this setup where we using a device which converts continuous time,

146
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:25,970
discrete time, more commonly called the government digital converter.

147
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:34,250
The model this is easier to hold, typically quickly, and that changes the original signal.

148
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:43,080
And some experts sample version X to actually into a sequence, text, graphics and.

149
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:54,360
According to the same family system in place to sequence sort of the way, if you like an index equal to the number of the sample,

150
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:01,170
that's the sequence that can be fed through a discrete system that can be done in real time as safely as the microbus is.

151
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:12,490
Ultimately, because in the context of real time processing, oh, it can be stored and processed later so that if you play that.

152
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:21,010
Using the system. And then the largest crypto system processing produces a little sequence,

153
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:30,970
what I do and what you need to come back into some two time, so that needs to be look to my.

154
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,280
So we continue to have a digital time to continue as planned.

155
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,510
I'm going to make all of the digital analogue converting and the result of that is a continuous time.

156
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:49,360
For was continuous time, plus continuous time. Think from last season, we often welcome this also comes as a Senate vote, Typekit response.

157
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:57,430
And then we've got everything the secret of his desire to see us and some 10 times so in practise,

158
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:02,800
the something time would be related to the processing time of the device you're using.

159
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,600
So for example, like massive 70 megahertz is your clock speed.

160
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,180
And so if you want to do something about you, you've got to have some.

161
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:20,340
Powers to. Keep a multiple of so, Babcock.

162
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,220
To drive to something.

163
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:34,610
Because I'm dropping it's so me to go using some kind of counter timer to count so many seconds and then send out a request to you to convert and,

164
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:43,110
you know, put your signal. And so you can be drunk or.

165
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:49,560
So basically, the final thing just to mention,

166
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:59,490
you can have a digital time signal that you can reach template so you can do something at modulation in discrete time.

167
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:05,970
You can also sample what some call, interpolate or downsample.

168
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:12,810
We get a straight to simply effective, actually. And with the code that we're going to show you.

169
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:22,530
So you can make up something, down something and do all kinds of things with the digital data once you've got it and to play around with it.

170
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:27,430
So the summary, this is what we've covered. We will cover in the session.

171
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:34,740
It'll be a little bit of a mixture of, I think, mostly club examples for the first half.

172
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,510
But we'll talk about something we've talked about,

173
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:44,970
something continuous time signals and the signal reconstruction using various types of code, if I think in the home.

174
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:52,470
First of all, the homes with those terms, you've got the screen time processing continuous time signals and or something in discrete time systems.

175
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,050
And the next session. Second half of of the section.

176
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:05,330
We'll talk about this at Transform and in the notes you'll find solutions to the problems and unwholesome.

177
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,290
That's for you to read and in the wonderful book.

178
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:17,510
So thanks very much for the attention. Hopefully you'll be able to absorb this predilection for them before the actual

179
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:22,920
session or certainly afterwards for some of the gaps that we won't be able to.

180
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:33,235
So thanks very much for watching, and I'll see you on Monday.
