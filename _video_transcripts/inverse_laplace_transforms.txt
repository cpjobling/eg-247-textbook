1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,700
So in the last pre-electoral, I talked about the LA Plus transform in this one,

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,830
I want to talk about the inverse LA Plus transform in this particular subject,

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:21,600
we're going to do more in class than we're going to do in the lecture, but I wanted to give you some examples of of how these computations work.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:31,560
So the definition of the inverse, the plus transform we looked at last time, it's this complex and integral and integration on the complex plane,

5
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:42,690
which in practise we don't typically use because we have these tables of transformers which have already worked out for us,

6
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:49,590
for the sort of systems we're looking at into this integration is really needed.

7
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,330
So as it says there, instead,

8
00:00:51,330 --> 00:01:02,900
we can really refer to examples of properties and come on transformer cars in order to compute these investment plus transforms.

9
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,390
And of course, if we're not in an exam, we can use a computer.

10
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:18,000
So because we're dealing with physical systems and usually those physical systems are defined by differential equations,

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,300
when we take the transfer of the differential equations, we end up with rational polynomials, such as illustrated on this slide here.

12
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,590
So we have a function f of us in the trunk from the main,

13
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,820
which is a numerator divided by the denominator and the numerator and denominator

14
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:52,030
are both polynomials in s with the coefficients B K and a K and it being linear.

15
00:01:52,030 --> 00:02:00,580
We have the idea of a proper and improper, rational function. These are related to proper fractions and improper fractions.

16
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:12,880
If you can remember, those from your school days basically means that if am that is the highest power of the denominator of the numerator,

17
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,190
sorry, the highest power. Oops. Let me go back.

18
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:27,500
If the highest power of the numerator?

19
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:39,620
And now he's part of the numerator is M and the highest power of the denominator, he's an M from Mike and for November.

20
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:47,630
Then if M is less than an f of, as is said to be proper, a proper,

21
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:56,150
rational function f m is greater than or equal to any f of us is said to be an improper from rational function.

22
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,330
And in terms of proper fractions and improper fractions,

23
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:09,100
that basically means an improper fraction will be one where the numerator was larger than the dominator.

24
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:16,000
In order to solve these kinds of problems, we need to be aware of a couple of mathematical concepts.

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:26,710
The idea of a zero is the first of these, so a zero is a value for which the rational part of it is zero.

26
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:39,520
And those will be values for which the numerator is zero. So when and as is equal to one of the roots of enemies, then f of us will be zero.

27
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:48,330
And so the roots of the numerator, the zeros of the rational polynomial.

28
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:59,760
And similarly, for polls, these are concerned with the zeros of the denominator, polynomial and those values for which divests equals zero.

29
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:11,100
So what as is one of those and the roots of dress, then f of us will be infinite because we've got a numerator divided by zero,

30
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,420
which is infinity, and these are called poles of the Houthis.

31
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,720
The reason that called Poles is probably something to do with what they look like if you plot them.

32
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:35,400
So imagine telegraph poles planted on the plane for those values for which d of S0, you get a very large peak appearing in the in the reference.

33
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,980
It's worth mentioning at this point for those people to control systems that poles and zeros

34
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:49,800
are a very important concept when it comes to looking at stability in control systems.

35
00:04:49,800 --> 00:05:00,270
A further simplified simplifying assumption we often use just to make the mathematics somewhat simpler is to make sure that the highest coefficient,

36
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,200
the coefficient of the highest per se in the denominator is unity.

37
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,590
And we can use it. We can always achieve this by just dividing if there is a coefficient, which is non unity.

38
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:18,960
We just divide the numerator and the dominated by that coefficient in order to to

39
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,690
ensure that property it doesn't look more come doesn't look simpler on this slide.

40
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,790
But since in practise, the A's and B's are just numbers.

41
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:39,960
Dividing through the B's by number is not that difficult of operation.

42
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:49,470
So as I said, because we're dealing typically with differential equations when we're dealing with the plus transforms,

43
00:05:49,470 --> 00:06:04,140
then the poles of a system are going to define the response of that system in terms of signals and the poles.

44
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,910
Excuse me. The poles can basically be all.

45
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:20,250
Rather, the solution of the response can be usually computed by doing a partial fraction expansion of PFI.

46
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,910
And there are several cases, so the poles are less f of X can be real,

47
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:30,940
distinct or real or repeated or complex conjugate pairs or a combination of these.

48
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:37,020
And so there are four cases to consider when we're looking at inverse la plus

49
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:44,790
transforming typical kinds of problems we're dealing with in of the systems.

50
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:51,230
So there are four cases the case where effervescence, distinct real polls.

51
00:06:51,230 --> 00:07:02,050
Think I should actually put that in the air?

52
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:11,920
The case where half is complex, Powell's case, where effervescence, repeated polls and the case were effervescent and improper, rational polynomial.

53
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,900
So we're going to give examples of each of these now and then we'll do some more in class.

54
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:28,140
But if you want the full details and please refer to chapter three of the textbook carries for full details.

55
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:40,110
So let us begin case of distinct polls. Scott, let me let me make that again explicit.

56
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:48,490
You know, these are making changes as I go here. This means that when you see these notes on the website that they will be corrected,

57
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:55,780
but some of the power some of the PDFs that were using in class may not have been.

58
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,710
OK, so the polls P1, P2, P3, pina distinct.

59
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:09,410
And we can then factor the denominator of f of us. You know, I like to see mathematical notation in my slides.

60
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,590
Let me correct that as well.

61
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:28,940
So we the fact was A5s is going to be some numerator divided by a product of these factors x minus P1, x minus P2 and so on.

62
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:34,160
So then we can expand that using partial friction expansion.

63
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:44,390
So A5s is going to be some value over s minus P1 and then added to a halt to rest minus P2.

64
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:50,440
And then we can find the inverse la plus transform of each of these these terms.

65
00:08:50,440 --> 00:09:00,210
And because of linearity, just not able together to find the corresponding function of time.

66
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:11,220
To evaluate the residue, as it's called the numerator of that partial fraction expansion expression, we had a number of ways we could do that.

67
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:21,300
But the simplest way to do it is to just multiply both sides by x minus peak and then let s go to peak.

68
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:31,170
In other words, as far as peak goes to zero. So and to solve these, we are basically keep forming this limit.

69
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:36,810
OK, the limit is as tends to peak of X minus peak A5s,

70
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:45,000
which is going to be estimated as peak off of us as equals peak for most is probably going to be dealing with.

71
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,160
So here's an example use of PFI method to simplify this function.

72
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:57,540
If one of us to find and find the time domain function of corresponding to f one of us.

73
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:10,200
So if one of us is to x plus five over a squared plus five x plus six and as we'll see in a minute, this denominator factor arises.

74
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:17,100
I always like to demonstrate the power of computers, so we've got Wolfram Alpha.

75
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:27,020
See if we can solve that. I'm just asking it to find the embezzler plus transform of that expression.

76
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:34,070
And it tells me that the result is a minus three to plus minus two.

77
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,930
So the sum of two decayed exponential on this one.

78
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:49,480
This is what the solution actually looks like, and I point six, for example.

79
00:10:49,480 --> 00:11:01,300
We kept going to particular value does actually show what the value is. So.

80
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:07,720
An alternative to using Wolfram Alpha is to use MATLAB. And I do like to be consistent.

81
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:20,380
I like to write MATLAB a case. There are still some, some rogues in the notes, so this is how we would do that in MATLAB.

82
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,150
We're using a numerical solution, first of all. So to do that, we first of all,

83
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:38,870
define two polynomials and we define a polynomial MATLAB by using a vector where the elements of the vector being the coefficients of the polynomial.

84
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:51,490
So this means to us plus five. And this means that squared plus five s plus six and a function to find the residues is this function or residue,

85
00:11:51,490 --> 00:12:01,840
which takes a new set of numerator coefficients and a certain denominator coefficients and computes the residue of the polls.

86
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:14,840
And again, if there is any additional gain, we would know we only have gained if it was a non proper, rational function.

87
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:23,840
So let us run that. So one of the beauties of the system I'm using here is a presenter.

88
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:29,690
I can execute that function in MATLAB and get better results, and you can see the residues of one.

89
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,860
And one of the poles of minus three and minus two.

90
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:39,170
And the key is the empty matrix, meaning is essentially zero.

91
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:45,110
So we interpret that as one of three plus one two plus two.

92
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:52,280
And then because of linearity property of the plus transform and using tables, we get the inverse.

93
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:59,330
The Plus transform f one of T minus three T plus it's minus two T because the plus the inverse,

94
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:07,280
the plus transfer model response rate is it's a minus three T one of response to this minus two.

95
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:14,420
Strictly speaking, we should have the unit step here. But we don't.

96
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:23,750
In this example, we also are able in MATLAB and we illustrate this more in the laboratory to come in a couple of weeks time.

97
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:30,650
We can use symbolic computation. OK? The results are precisely as an expression.

98
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:35,550
So this is how we do that MATLAB. We define a pair of symbols.

99
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,670
S.A. so that they represent that a plus transform a very long time.

100
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:46,940
And then we write down the expression of the Russian economy using those symbols.

101
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:53,750
So two times as +5 over as squared, plus five US six.

102
00:13:53,750 --> 00:14:01,010
Notice we have to use a notation that you're familiar with from programming asterisk,

103
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:09,290
represent multiplication slots representing division and notice the use of brackets to make sure that we don't.

104
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,200
We group things properly.

105
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:22,470
And so in order to compute that we just say a reversal plus chance for all of us because assets are symbols MATLAB really well,

106
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:28,760
assume the S is the plus transferable variable and to use the time variable and give us back a result.

107
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:37,340
We can make that look a little bit better using this pretty function.

108
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:50,850
This will take a little bit of time because it has to load the symbolic toolbox and do some bit of compilation.

109
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:59,460
But eventually, it comes back with the expression exponential minus two to plus exponential minus three T.

110
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:05,930
Just out of interest if I remove that pretty function.

111
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:22,810
I'm ready to go. This is what we'll get, right.

112
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:32,320
So we need to take semicolon the way that we go. You can see the difference with pretty this is that if you don't use pretty,

113
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:44,540
we get the actual functions, the contract computing version of the expression.

114
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:57,390
It's time that. OK, so that's the first example, a second example is using a more complex expression.

115
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:06,390
This time we've got a denominator, which is a cubic and not quite so easy to run our factories.

116
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:16,010
Again, we can look at Wolfram Alpha to see if that won't give us an answer.

117
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:29,130
And indeed, it does. It's done a little bit of simplification with the result that was not economical, this is the form we'd normally see it in.

118
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,270
This is the expression that we will be coming back with.

119
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:47,710
But yes, it does solve and we've got three routes at minus five, minus three and minus T three poles.

120
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:54,610
So, um, because that's the cue, because I said difficult to voucherize without computer systems.

121
00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:01,690
So we're using MATLAB to factories that one way of doing that is to use this factor function.

122
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:08,650
So we give it the point I only wish to factories and it returns results.

123
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:13,810
So the factors are as follows three x plus five x plus one.

124
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:28,830
Once we have those factors, we can then. Complete the the result, which comes out to this and will prove that in class.

125
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:34,980
The second case we want to look at is the case where we have complex poles.

126
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,780
So if you have complex poles,

127
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:53,520
that means there and there's an minus sigma plus J omega type relationship and they always appear as complex conjugate pairs.

128
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:04,830
So if there's if P.K. is a complex root of DMs and so is its complex conjugate p conjugate of K.

129
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:10,560
You can still use PFG with complex poles, just put in the the values,

130
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:18,420
usually with Formula One use values as complex values, which the muscle is a bit trickier to get right.

131
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:28,830
But it's often easier just to use the fact that for these types of responses, we're going to get a decaying sinusoidal.

132
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:35,250
So if the poles the rest minus eight squared plus omega squared plus transfer will be to the 18th.

133
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:41,520
In the sign on, I could see sort of the inverse of Panopto that will be that.

134
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:53,050
And for this case, of course, we can use that to transform into partial function.

135
00:18:53,050 --> 00:19:02,100
So here we want to find the expression as +3 as +1 one, as far as eight.

136
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:10,630
Sometimes the maths doesn't give you quite what you're looking for in these situations.

137
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:17,530
So it's return an expression here involving imaginary values, the exponents,

138
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:25,570
which is not really what we're looking for, this is more what we are expecting, assuming that T is real.

139
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:33,850
It's going to be a ticking exponential times, a sign and a cost plus a decade exponential turn.

140
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:43,250
That's what we'll be expecting to see.

141
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:54,560
So in order to do that, this is how we proceed, we take the pulp, the quadratic term, which is going to give us the complex roots.

142
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,160
It's as far, I suppose, eight. And then we found the square.

143
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:08,330
So that's that squared was to all squared will be x squared plus four x plus four to make eight.

144
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:18,200
We need to add form. So that completes the square there and we look at the desired form and then we see the A's minus two squared is going to be four.

145
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,150
So I'll make it is going to be two and then we form the structure expansion.

146
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:29,710
I want the rest plus one to arrest positive for this and this and in this particular case,

147
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:40,940
probably use the method of the of cross multiplying and then solving the simultaneous equations in order to solve for one or two and three.

148
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:52,870
But the result will be this expression, which was basically what was in the Wolfram Alpha case.

149
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:57,520
The other case that crops up is where we have repeated polls.

150
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,500
So there is one poll that's minus P, which appears more than once.

151
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:08,980
And that situation, this is what the expression is going to expand to.

152
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:19,290
And we're going to use the. Looks like T Square T appearing in the expressions to compute those coefficients,

153
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:29,670
we use this general formula and we're using repeated derivatives of the expression.

154
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:39,480
So in order to solve this, this problem where we have X plus one being the repeat squirts of minus one is the repeat route,

155
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:56,160
then we're going to expect to see this expression appearing in the result, we can use Wolfram Alpha two to find the solution.

156
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:02,610
And it gives us this expression, which is more economical.

157
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:15,040
This one notice tweets the minus T two x minus T appears twice, but one of them is multiplied by T.

158
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:33,010
And they can we can solvency MATLAB. Which we will might maybe do later.

159
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:36,190
And then finally, have a case of improper, rational polynomials,

160
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:45,460
we can deal with this quite easily because basically what's going to end up is we're going to have a sort of partial function like this,

161
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:51,010
plus the original irrational polynomial. So we do some division in order to make it non-rational.

162
00:22:51,010 --> 00:23:00,700
So this is a little bit let's come to the excess amount on a improper fraction and this is the bit it represents.

163
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:10,600
The subsidy is proper. So there's an example ask about was to ask us to address this problem.

164
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:27,670
This is improper because the Enumerates has got a higher order of assets and the later again, we can make a it in Wolfram Alpha or MATLAB.

165
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:34,060
And notice the result comes back with Delta T, plus Delta 215 of the derivative delta.

166
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:41,110
These are two. That's interesting. So let's see where that comes from.

167
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:49,500
So dividing a squared plus two plus two minus was one we get X plus one plus one arrest was one one arrest.

168
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:56,690
This one transforms to either minus two, so straight forward the one.

169
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:05,540
Transforms the Delta T. What about the this with the transform of the S?

170
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:11,300
Well, to get to that, we would need to go back in theory a little bit.

171
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:21,950
So if you recall from what we did and in the second part of the first week's lectures on the elementary signals, we looked at this function.

172
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:29,920
The derivative you not see is, you know, dash of which is Delta T.

173
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:38,210
So the second reactor, you know, to see is going to be dealt a [INAUDIBLE].

174
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:49,240
So part of the time differentiate proper to the second derivative you've got a to, he's going to be dealt a [INAUDIBLE].

175
00:24:49,240 --> 00:25:00,260
Which is going to be as squared times in the past transfer or even out of T minus as time, you know, to T.

176
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:24,810
Should we no, not. And minus DADT, if you don't have to, which is the initial condition that equals not squared times, one of us which uses.

177
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:36,070
So I got a new transformer, as his delta does take the derivative of Delta, and in general, that's the derivative of Delta T.

178
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:49,270
He's asked the end. So expression putting that value back into the expression is he's minus T plus Delta T plus Delta City.

179
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:53,740
We can verify that by getting some MATLAB.

180
00:25:53,740 --> 00:26:07,990
So the residue is one of the pole is minus one, and then you've got this extra tail on one, which means as close warm as the remainder.

181
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:23,090
And so we can. Solve that, and using a plus transform their regret x minus T plus direct T plus Derek warm up to you,

182
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:29,870
which is the first derivative of Dirac friendship during delta function.

183
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:39,980
So some homework for the end of this chapter, there are some problems in Carris which we urge you to have a look at.

184
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:46,600
Again, don't look at the answers before you've done the problems.

185
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:56,810
Well, we have all of my club solutions for this lecture available for you in the Mutlak folder that comes with these notes,

186
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:04,970
and they're also on MATLAB online. So this function here will compute the real poles as well compute the cubic denominator.

187
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:10,100
This is the complex, for example, repeated and the proper functions.

188
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:22,570
You might want to have a look at those later. So, for example, if we go to.

189
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:40,880
That expression. We go there is the first of those files.

190
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:50,210
And takes some time, Macklem, when he first starts up, is quite slow as they compile things on the fly.

191
00:27:50,210 --> 00:28:04,680
And we go, so that's the function defined. I can actually run this.

192
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:11,400
And the expressions, well, be able to see them because it's running inside a console,

193
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:21,020
which you haven't got on the screen, but I can run that expression.

194
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:30,210
And my club had be just come out of that, so we don't see that.

195
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,940
And. There we go.

196
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:51,250
So the result is for minus one poles minus two minus one, and the expression is this.

197
00:28:51,250 --> 00:29:01,310
OK. So in the lab, which is going to be a week on Tuesday,

198
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:07,280
we're going to explore two provided by month after taking the blood transforms unrepresented polynomials,

199
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:12,380
finding roots, voucherizing polynomials and the solution of the inverse plus transform.

200
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:19,820
So that would be this lecture precedes the lecture him on the 1st of February.

201
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:27,290
This will be on the 8th of February, 9th of February, and we actually get to do this in the laboratory.

202
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:42,290
OK. Thanks for watching a bit longer, perhaps. But then we go to the pre lecture for the class and we'll do some examples in the class to focus on.

203
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:46,936
Thanks for watching again. See you soon.
