1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,700
So in the last pre-lecture, I talked about the Laplace transform. In this one,

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,830
I want to talk about the inverse Laplace transform. In this particular subject,

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:21,600
we're going to do more in class than we're going to do in the lecture, but I wanted to give you some examples of how these computations work.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:31,560
So the definition of the inverse Laplace transform we looked at last time, is this complex integral, and integration on the complex plane,

5
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:42,690
which in practise we don't typically use because we have these tables of transforms which have already been worked out for us,

6
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:49,590
for the sort of systems we're looking at, this integration is rarely needed.

7
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,330
So as it says there, instead,

8
00:00:51,330 --> 00:01:02,900
we;ll refer to tables of properties and common transform pairs in order to compute these inverse Laplace transforms.

9
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,390
And of course, if we're not in an exam, we can use a computer.

10
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:18,000
So because we're dealing with physical systems and usually those physical systems are defined by differential equations,

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,300
when we take the Laplace transform of those differential equations, we end up with rational polynomials, such as illustrated on this slide here.

12
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,590
So we have a function F(s) in the transform domain,

13
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,820
which is a numerator divided by the denominator and the numerator and denominator

14
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:52,030
are both polynomials in s with the coefficients b_k and a_k, erm, it being linear.

15
00:01:52,030 --> 00:02:00,580
We have the idea of a proper and improper, rational function. These are related to proper fractions and improper fractions.

16
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:12,880
If you can remember, those from your school days, basically means that if m, that is the highest power of the denominator, of the numerator,

17
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,190
sorry, the highest power. Oops. Let me go back.

18
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:27,500
If the highest power of the numerator ... oh, I'll get there in the end

19
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:39,620
And the highest power of the numerator is m and the highest power of the denominator is n, m for Mike, n for November.

20
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:47,630
Then if m is less than n F(s) is said to be proper, a proper,

21
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:56,150
rational function. If m is greater than or equal to n, F(s) is said to be an improper rational function.

22
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,330
And in terms of proper fractions and improper fractions,

23
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:09,100
that basically means an improper fraction will be one where the numerator was larger than the dominator.

24
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:16,000
In order to solve these kinds of problems, we need to be aware of a couple of mathematical concepts.

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:26,710
The idea of a zero is the first of these. So a zero is a value for which the rational polynomial is zero.

26
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:39,520
And those will be values for which the numerator is zero. So when s is equal to one of the roots of N(s), then F(s) will be zero.

27
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:48,330
And so the roots of the numerator are the zeros of the rational polynomial.

28
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:59,760
And similarly, for poles, these are concerned with the zeros of the denominator polynomial and those values for which D(s) equals zero.

29
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:11,100
So when s is one of those n-roots of D(S), then F(s) will be infinite because we've got a numerator divided by zero,

30
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,420
which is infinity, and these are called poles of F(s).

31
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,720
The reason that called poles is probably something to do with what they look like if you plot them.

32
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:35,400
So imagine telegraph poles planted on the s-plane for those values for which D(s) = 0. You'll get a very large peak appearing in the surface.

33
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,980
It's worth mentioning at this point, for those people doing control systems, that poles and zeros

34
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:49,800
are a very important concept when it comes to looking at stability in control systems.

35
00:04:49,800 --> 00:05:00,270
A further simplifying assumption we often use, just to make the mathematics somewhat simpler, is to make sure that the highest coefficient,

36
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,200
the coefficient of the highest power of s in the denominator, is unity.

37
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,590
And we can usually, we can always achieve this by just dividing: if there is a coefficient which is non unity.

38
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:18,960
We just divide the numerator and the denomonator by that coefficient in order to to

39
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,690
ensure that property. It doesn't look simpler on this slide.

40
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,790
But since in practise, the A's and B's are just numbers.

41
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:39,960
Dividing through the B's by a number is not that difficult an operation.

42
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:49,470
So, as I said, because we're dealing typically with differential equations when we're dealing with the Laplace transforms,

43
00:05:49,470 --> 00:06:04,140
then the poles of a system are going to define the response of that system in terms of signals, and the poles.

44
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,910
Excuse me. The poles can basically be, or

45
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:20,250
Rather, the solution of the response can be usually computed by doing a partial fraction expansion or PFE.

46
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,910
And there are several cases, so the poles of F(s) can be real,

47
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:30,940
and distinct, or real and repeated, or complex conjugate pairs, or a combination of these.

48
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:37,020
And so there are four cases to consider when we're looking at inverse Laplace

49
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:44,790
transforming the typical kinds of problems we're dealing with in of the systems.

50
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:51,230
So there are four cases the case where F(s) has distinct real poles.

51
00:06:51,230 --> 00:07:02,050
Think I should actually put that in here.

52
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:11,920
The case where F(s) has complex poles, the case, where F(s) has repeated real poles and the case where F(s) is an improper, rational polynomial.

53
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,900
So we're going to give examples of each of these now and then we'll do some more in class.

54
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:28,140
But if you want the full details then please refer to Chapter three of the textbook, Karris, for full details.

55
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:40,110
So let us begin case of distinct poles. In fact, let me let me make that again explicit.

56
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:48,490
You' notice that I m making changes as I go here. This means that when you see these notes on the website that they will be corrected,

57
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:55,780
but some of the PDFs that we're using in class may not have been.

58
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,710
OK, so the poles p1, p2, p3, p_n are [real and] distinct.

59
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:09,410
And we can then factor the denominator of F(s). You know, I like to see mathematical notation in my slides.

60
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,590
Let me correct that as well.

61
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:28,940
So we see that F(s) is going to be some numerator divided by a product of these factors (s - p1), (s = p2) and so on.

62
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:34,160
So then we can expand that using partial fraction expansion.

63
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:44,390
So F(s) is going to be some value (r1) over (s - p1) and then added r2/(s - p2)....

64
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:50,440
And then we can find the inverse Laplace transform of each of these these terms.

65
00:08:50,440 --> 00:09:00,210
And because of linearity, just add them together to find the corresponding function of time.

66
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:11,220
To evaluate the residue, as it's called, the numerator of that partial fraction expansion expression, we havw a number of ways we could do that,

67
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:21,300
but the simplest way to do it is to just multiply both sides by (s - p_k) and then let s go to p_k.

68
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:31,170
In other words, as (s - p_k) goes to zero. So to solve these, we are basically forming this limit.

69
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:36,810
r_k is the limit is as s tends to p_k of (s - p_k) [times] F(s),

70
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:45,000
which is going to be (s - p_k) F(s) at s = p_k peak for most of the problems we are going to be dealing with.

71
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,160
So here's an example. Use the PFE method to simplify this function.

72
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:57,540
F1(s) to find, and find the time domain function f1(t) that corresponds to F1(s).

73
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:10,200
So f1(s) is to (s + 5) over s^2 + 5s + 6, and as we'll see in a minute, this denominator factorizes.

74
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:17,100
I always like to demonstrate the power of computers, so we've got Wolfram Alpha.

75
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:27,020
See if we can solve that. I'm just asking it to find the inverse Laplace transform of that expression.

76
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:34,070
And it tells me that the result is exp(-3t) + exp(-2t).

77
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,930
So the sum of two decayed exponentials on this one.

78
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:49,480
This is what the solution actually looks like, and at 0.6, for example.

79
00:10:49,480 --> 00:11:01,300
We get a particular value. It doesn't actually show what the value is. So.

80
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:07,720
An alternative to using Wolfram Alpha is to use MATLAB. And I do like to be consistent.

81
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:20,380
I like to write MATLAB all upper case. There are still some, some rogues in the notes, so this is how we would do that in MATLAB.

82
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,150
We're using a numerical solution, first of all. So to do that, we first of all,

83
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:38,870
define two polynomials and we define a polynomial in MATLAB by using a vector with the elements of the vector being the coefficients of the polynomial.

84
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:51,490
So this means s + 5. And this means that ss^2 + 5s + 6. And a function to find the residues is this function is "residue",

85
00:11:51,490 --> 00:12:01,840
which takes a set of numerator coefficients and a set of denominator coefficients and computes the residue of the poles.

86
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:14,840
And the gain, if there is any additional gain. We would only have gain if it was a non proper, rational function.

87
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:23,840
So let us run that. So one of the beauties of the system I'm using here as a presenter.

88
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:29,690
I can execute that function in MATLAB and get back the results. And you can see the residues are 1.

89
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,860
And 1. The poles are -3 and -2.

90
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:39,170
And the k is the empty matrix, meaning is essentially zero.

91
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:45,110
So we interpret that as 1/(s + 3) + 1/(s + 2).

92
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:52,280
And then because of linearity property of the Laplace transform and using tables, we get the inverse.

93
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:59,330
Laplace transform f1(t) = exp(-3t) + exp(-2t) because Laplace, the inverse,

94
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:07,280
Laplace transform pf 1/(s + 3) is exp(-3t) and the inverse Laplace transform of 1/(s + 2) is exp(-2t).

95
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:14,420
Strictly speaking, we should have the unit step here. But we don't

96
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:23,750
in this example. We also are able in MATLAB, and we illustrate this more in the laboratory to come in a couple of weeks time,

97
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:30,650
we can use symbolic computation. To get the results precisely as a [mathematical] expression.

98
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:35,550
So this is how we do that MATLAB. We define a pair of symbols

99
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,670
s and t so that they represent the Laplace transform variable s and time.

100
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:46,940
And then we write down the expression as a rational polynomial using those symbols.

101
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:53,750
So (2*s + 2)/(s^2 + 5*s + 6).

102
00:13:53,750 --> 00:14:01,010
Notice we have to use a notation that you're familiar with from programming, the asterisk

103
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:09,290
represents multiplication, slash '/' represents division and notice the use of brackets to make sure that we 

104
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,200
group things properly.

105
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:22,470
And so in order to compute that we just say inverse Laplace transform of F(s) [ilaplace(Fs)] because s and t are symbols MATLAB will

106
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:28,760
assume that s is the Laplace transform variable and t is the time variable and give us back a result.

107
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:37,340
We can make that look a little bit better using this pretty function.

108
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:50,850
This will take a little bit of time because it has to load the symbolic toolbox and do a bit of compilation.

109
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:59,460
But eventually, it comes back with the expression exp(-2t) plus exp(-3t).

110
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:05,930
Just out of interest if I remove that pretty function.

111
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:22,810
and run it again. This is what we'll get.

112
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:32,320
Sorry, I need to take the semicolon away. There we go. You can see the difference with pretty this is that if you don't use pretty,

113
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:44,540
we get the actual functions, the computing version of the expression.

114
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:57,390
Let's tidy that up. OK, so that's the first example, a second example is using a more complex expression.

115
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:06,390
This time we've got a denominator, which is a cubic and not quite so easy to factorise.

116
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:16,010
Again, we can look at Wolfram Alpha to see if that will give us an answer.

117
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:29,130
And indeed, it does. It's done a little bit of simplification with the result there, It's not canonical, this is the form we'd normally see it in.

118
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,270
This is the expression that we will be coming back with.

119
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:47,710
But yes, it does solve and we've got 3 roots at -5, -3 and minus -1. Three poles.

120
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:54,610
So, um, because that's the cubic, as I said difficult to factorise without computer assistance.

121
00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:01,690
So we're using MATLAB to factorise that. One way of doing that is to use this "factor" function.

122
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:08,650
So we give it the polynomial we wish to factorise and it returns results.

123
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:13,810
So the factors are s + 3,  s + 5, s + 1.

124
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:28,830
Once we have those factors, we can them to compute the the result, which comes out to this and will prove that in class.

125
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:34,980
The second case we want to look at is the case where we have complex poles.

126
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,780
So if you have complex poles,

127
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:53,520
that means there and there's - sigma - j omega type relationship and they always appear as complex conjugate pairs.

128
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:04,830
So if there's, if p_k is a complex root of D(s) and so is its complex conjugate p*_k.

129
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:10,560
You can still use PFE with complex poles, just put in the the values,

130
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:18,420
using the formula [for the residues] use values as complex values, but the maths is a bit trickier to get right.

131
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:28,830
But it's often easier just to use the fact that for these types of responses, we're going to get a decaying sinusoid.

132
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:35,250
So if the poles are (s - a)^2 + omega^2 the Laplace transform will be 

133
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:41,520
exp(at) sin(omega t), or sorry the inverse Laplace transform  will be that.

134
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:53,050
And for this case, cos, we can use that transform then to partial fraction.

135
00:18:53,050 --> 00:19:02,100
So here we want to find the expression (s + 3)/((s + 1)(s^2 + 4s + 8)).

136
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:10,630
Sometimes the maths [in Wolfram Alpha] doesn't give you quite what you're looking for in these situations.

137
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:17,530
So it's returned an expression here involving imaginary values, the exponents,

138
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:25,570
which is not really what we're looking for. This is more what we are expecting, assuming that t is real,

139
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:33,850
It's going to be a decaying exponential times a sin and a cos plus a decaying exponential turn.

140
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:43,250
That's what we'll be expecting to see.

141
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:54,560
So in order to do that, this is how we proceed, we take the quadratic term, which is going to give us the complex roots.

142
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,160
s^2 + 4s + 8. And then we form the square.

143
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:08,330
So that's that's (s + 2)^2 will be (s^2 + 4s + 4) + 4 to make 8.

144
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:18,200
We need to add 4. So that completes the square there and we look at the desired form and we see a = -2 and omega^2 is going to be four.

145
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,150
So omega is going to be two and then we form the partial fraction expansion.

146
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:29,710
r1/(s + 1) + r2(s + 2) and this. And in this particular case, we would

147
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:40,940
probably use the method of cross multiplying and then solving the simultaneous equations in order to solve for r1, and r2 and r3.

148
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:52,870
But the result will be this expression, which was basically what was in the Wolfram Alpha case.

149
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:57,520
The other case that crops up is where we have repeated poles.

150
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,500
So there is one pole that's (s - p1), which appears more than once.

151
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:08,980
And that situation, this is what the expression is going to expand to.

152
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:19,290
And we're going to use the. We're going to find t and t^2 appearing in the expressions. To compute those coefficients,

153
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:29,670
we use this general formula and we're using repeated derivatives of the expression.

154
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:39,480
So in order to solve this, this problem where we have (s + 1) being a repeat, squared, s = -1 is the repeated root,

155
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:56,160
then we're going to expect to see this expression appearing in the result. We can use Wolfram Alpha two to find the solution.

156
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:02,610
And it gives us this expression, which is more canonical than

157
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:15,040
this one. Notice exp(-t) appears twice, but one of them is multiplied by t.

158
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:33,010
And again, we can solve this in MATLAB. Which we will maybe do later.

159
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:36,190
And then finally, we have a case of improper, rational polynomials,

160
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:45,460
we can deal with this quite easily because basically what we are going to end up is, we're going to have a sort of partial function like this,

161
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:51,010
plus the original non-proper polynomial. So we do some division in order to make it proper.

162
00:22:51,010 --> 00:23:00,700
So this is a little bit let's come to the excess amount on a improper fraction and this is the bit it represents.

163
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:10,600
The bit that is proper. So there's an example (s^2 + 2s + 2)/(s + 1).

164
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:27,670
This is improper because the numerator has got a higher order of s in the numerator than in the denominator. Again we solve it in Wolfram Alpha or MATLAB.

165
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:34,060
And notice the result comes back with delta(t) + delta'(t), or the derivative of delta(t) and

166
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:41,110
exp(-t). That's interesting. So let's see where that comes from.

167
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:49,500
So dividing (s^2 + 2s + 1) by (s + 1) we get s + 1 + 1/(s + 1). 1/(s + 1)

168
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:56,690
transforms to exp(-t), so that's straight forward. The one.

169
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:05,540
transforms into delta(t). What about the this? What is the inverse transform of s?

170
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:11,300
Well, to get to that, we would need to go back to the theory a little bit.

171
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:21,950
So if you recall from what we did and in the second part of the first week's lectures on elementary signals, we looked at this function.

172
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:29,920
The derivative of u0(t) = u0'(t) = delta(t).

173
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:38,210
So the second derivative of u0(t) is going to be delta'(t).

174
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:49,240
So by the time derivative property, the second derivative of u0(t) us going to be delta'(t)

175
00:24:49,240 --> 00:25:00,260
Which is going to be s^2 times the Laplace transform of u0(t) minus s times u0(0-).

176
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:24,810
That should be t not 0 [actually it should be 0-!], and - d/dt u0(t) at t = 0- which is the initial condition at t = 0.  That is s^2 time 1/s which is s.

177
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:36,070
So we've got a new transform pair, s <=> delta'(t) or the derivative of delta. And in general, the n-derivative of delta(t).

178
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:49,270
is s^n. So expression, putting that value back into the expression exp(-t) - delta(t) - delta'(t).

179
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:53,740
We can verify that by doing some MATLAB.

180
00:25:53,740 --> 00:26:07,990
So the residue is one, the pole is -1, and then you've got this extra term [1 1], which means s + 1 is the remainder.

181
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:23,090
And so we can solve that, and using [the inverse] Laplace transform you get exp(-t) +  dirac(t) + dirac(1, t),

182
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:29,870
which is the first derivative of the Dirac function, Dirac delta function.

183
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:39,980
So some homework for the end of this chapter, there are some problems in Karris which we urge you to have a look at.

184
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:46,600
Again, don't look at the answers before you've done the problems.

185
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:56,810
We have all the MATLAB solutions for this lecture available for you in the matlab folder that comes with these notes,

186
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:04,970
and they're also on MATLAB online. So this function here will compute the real poles as well as computing the cubic denominator.

187
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:10,100
This is the complex, for example, repeated and the proper functions.

188
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:22,570
You might want to have a look at those later. So, for example, if we go to.

189
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:40,880
That expression. We go there is the first of those files.

190
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:50,210
And takes some time, MATLAB, when he first starts up, is quite slow as they compile things on the fly.

191
00:27:50,210 --> 00:28:04,680
And we go, so that's the function defined. I can actually run this.

192
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:11,400
And the expressions, well, won't be able to see them because it's running inside a console,

193
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:21,020
which you haven't got on the screen, but I can run that expression.

194
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:30,210
And MATLAB here just comment out that, so we don't see that.

195
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,940
And. There we go.

196
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:51,250
So the result is 4, -1, poles -2 -1 , and the expression is this.

197
00:28:51,250 --> 00:29:01,310
OK. So in the lab, which is going to be a week on Tuesday,

198
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:07,280
we're going to explore the tools provided by MATLAB for taking Laplace transforms, representing polynomials,
199
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:12,380
finding roots, factorising polynomials and the solution of inverse Laplace transform problems.

200
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:19,820
So that would be, this lecture precedes the class to be given on the 1st of February,

201
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:27,290
This will be on the 9th of February, and we actually get to do this in the laboratory.

202
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:42,290
OK. Thanks for watching. A bit longer, perhaps. But then we go to the pre lecture for the class and we'll do some examples in the class to focus on.

203
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:46,936
Thanks for watching again. See you soon.
