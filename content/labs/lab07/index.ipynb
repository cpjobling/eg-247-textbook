    "### Lab Exercise 15: Interactive Filter Design\n",
    "\n",
    "MATLAB provides a filter design tool with a graphical user interface called `fdatool`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want you to use this tool to design and test a low-pass, band-pass and high-pass Butterworth filter with sampling frequency equal to 44.1 kHz. The filter should implement the first, second and third stage in a three-stage graphic equalizer with a low pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 31.5 Hz, a pass-band filter for the middle filter (f<sub>1</sub>  to f<sub>2</sub>) of about one octave and centre-frequency fc equal to 63 hz and a high-pass filter with pass-frequency of 125 Hz.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this exercise is to determine the order of the Butterworth filters to be used in your design and the Q factor needed (where  Q = f<sub>c</sub> / (f<sub>2</sub> – f<sub>1</sub>)) for the pass-band filters required to implement the mid-range of your 10-stage graphic equalizer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The centre pass-band filter should be designed so that f<sub>2</sub> & f<sub>1</sub> satisfies f<sub>c</sub> = (f<sub>1</sub>f<sub>2</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>.  Your goal is to find the ∆f value for this filter that achieves a flat frequency response when it is combined with equal weight to the low-pass and high-pass filters.  "
