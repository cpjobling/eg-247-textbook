To build your site, take the following steps.:

0. (optionally) clean out the auto-generated folders by running

       make clean

1. Build the textbook by navigating to the site root, and running the following command:

       make book

   This will:

   * Use the links specified in the `_data/toc.yml` file (pointing to files in `/content/`) and
     do the following: 
   * Run `nbconvert` to turn the `.ipynb` files into markdown
   * Replace relative image file paths so that they work on your new built site
   * Clean up formatting issues for things like MathJax to display properly
   * Place all these generated files in the `/_build/` directory.

2. From here, you have **two options**
    * **Option 1: Jekyll builds the site for you**: By default, pushing a repository
      cloned from Jupyter Book will tell GitHub to use Jekyll to build the repository
      when you push changes (your repository is configured properly on GitHub).
      Simply tell GitHub to build a site from your repo, then push the changes to
      your GitHub repo and that's it!
    * **Option 2: Build your site's HTML locally**:

      When you build the site locally, all of the HTML needed to run the site is
      generated in your `_site/` folder. This can be copy/pasted into whatever site
      management setup you would like. GitHub can also host the raw HTML of a site
      if you add a `.nojekyll` file to the root of the repository that hosts your site.

      To summarize, you can take the following steps:

      * `make build` will build the site locally and place the HTML in the `_site/` folder.
      * `touch .nojekyll` will create an empty `.nojekyll` file that will prevent GitHub from
        trying to use Jekyll to build your site.

* Push your site to GitHub and configure it to build a website out of your repository.
You can the push the changes to GitHub, which will automatically build a Jekyll site with
your newly-created Markdown files. We'll cover this next.

## When should you build the HTML locally?

You might ask: if GitHub pages can build my site automatically from the markdown files, why
build it locally? The main reason for this is that you get more flexibility by building locally
and serving raw HTML, as opposed to auto-building the site with GitHub-pages.

In particular, if you wish to use any **extra Jekyll plugins**, such as the `jekyll-scholar` plugin that
enables you to add citations and bibliographies, then you need to build your site
locally as HTML. GitHub-pages doesn't let you enable any extra plugins if it auto-builds your site.
