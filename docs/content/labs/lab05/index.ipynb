    "In this lab exercise we will review the Fourier series for a square wave with odd and even symmetry before going on to compute and plot the Fourier series for the *triangular* waveform.\n",

In other words, it reconstructs the $a_k$ and $b_k$ Coefficients from the exponential Fourier series coefficients $C_k$.\n",

    "A problem with the scripts as provided is that the limits on the integrals are set in the range $[0, T]$. It would be convenient if this could be changed, for example when computing FS for even signals, the limits could be adjusted to $[-T/2,T/2]$. \n",

    "Examine the code for the `FourierSeries` function that is defined in `FourierSeries.m`. Adapt the function definition so that the user can define the range of the Fourier Series integral. If you succeed, use the modified function to compute the Fourier series of the triangular wave form by exploiting half-wave symmetry. Save the script that does this as `ex11_3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine the code that is defined in `TrigFourierSeries`. Note that it calls `FourierSeries` then computes `ak` and `bk` from the `Ck` coefficients. Why did I do that do you think? \n",
