    "The lab component will be assessed based on a portfolio of the MATLAB scripts, Simulink models and publishable MATLAB Live Scripts. You should therefore aim to keep all the files from each lab session in a suitable folder in your workspace on the `p:\\` drive. I would suggest a structure like **eg-247-textbook\\portfolio\\lab01** which matches the layout of the files on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cpjobling/eg-247-textbook/tree/master/portfolio).\n",
    "\n",

    "If you do not use GitHub as the master repository of your portfolio, please ensure that you backup your work files regularly. You will be required to submit some or all of them for assessment."

If you have problems running any files that are submitted, please note this in your feedback.\n",

    "1. Open the Live Script file `elem_signals.mlx` and execute **run all**. Check that the results are all present and that there are no errors. Review the formatting of the file and think about how readable and understandable the script is as a record of the experiment. \n",
    "2. Open and run the Simulink model `signal.slx` and confirm that the results match the figure given above. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the grading rubric to confirm your peer's self assessment. **Note** you may may award a higher mark if you feel that the student has marked themselves too harshly! You should give a reason for your score if it does not agree with the student's own self-assessment. \n",

    "\n",
    "* Any problems you encountered checking your peer's submission.\n",
    "* Use of headings and sections to break up the Live Script documentation of the lab exercise.\n",
    "* Good use of textual comments in the Live Script file to explain the MATLAB code.\n",
