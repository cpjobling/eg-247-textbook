    "1. Open the Live Script file `proj2.mlx` and execute **run all**. Check that the results are all present and that there are no errors. Review the formatting of the file and think about how readable and understandable the script is as a record of the experiment. \n",
    "2. Open the Simulink model `proj2.slx`. Review the transfer function block and confirm that it matches the values computed in `proj2.mlx`. Run the simulation and check the results.\n",
    "3. Review the live Script files `ex4.mlx`, `ex5.mlx` and `ex6.mlx` in the same way that you did for `proj2.mlx`. Comment on your findings. \n",
