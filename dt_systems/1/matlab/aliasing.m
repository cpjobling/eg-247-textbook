%% Aliasing 
%
% An illustration of aliasing due to undersampling.
%
% In this example, we sample a cosine waveform with frequency
% $\omega_0$ = 10 rad/s at a sampling rate $\omega_s = 1.5\omega_0$.
% That is less than the minimum $\omega_s = 2\omega_0$.

A = 2;
w0 = 10;
ws = 1.5*w0;
Ts = 2*pi/ws;
tmax = 2*(2*pi/w0);
t = linspace(0,tmax,1000);
plot(t,A*cos(w0*t),'r')
hold on
%% Now we sample
ts = 0:Ts:tmax;
stem(ts,A*cos(w0*ts))
%% 
% we observe that a waveform with half the frequency of the original
% would have the same sampled points.
plot(t,A*cos(w0*t/2),'g-.')
