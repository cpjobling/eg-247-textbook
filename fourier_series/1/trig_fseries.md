# Unit 3.1: Trigonometric Fourier Series



Any periodic waveform can be approximated by a DC component (which may be 0) and the sum of the fundamental and harmomic sinusoidal waveforms. This has important applications in many applications of electronics but is particularly crucial for signal processing and communications.

## Motivating Examples

This [Fourier Series demo](http://dspfirst.gatech.edu/matlab/#fseriesdemo), developed by Members of the Center for Signal and Image Processing (CSIP) at the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), shows how periodic signals can be synthesised by a sum of sinusoidal signals.

It is here used as a motivational example in our introduction to [Fourier Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series). (See also [Fourier Series](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FourierSeries.html) from Wolfram MathWorld referenced in the **Quick Reference** on Blackboard.)

To install this example, download the [zip file](http://dspfirst.gatech.edu/matlab/ZipFiles/fseriesdemo-v144.zip) and unpack it somewhere on your MATLAB path.

## Wave Analysis

* [Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier) (21 March 1768 â€“ 16 May 1830) discovered that any _**periodic**_ signal could be represented as a series of *harmonically related* sinusoids.

* An *harmonic* is a frequency whose value is an integer multiple of some *fundamental frequency*

* For example, the frequencies 2 MHz, 3 Mhz, 4 MHz are the second, third and fourth harmonics of a sinusoid with fundamental frequency 1 Mhz.

### The Trigonometric Fourier Series

Any periodic waveform $f(t)$ can be represented as

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
  f(t) &=& \frac{1}{2}{a_0} + {a_1}\cos \Omega_0 t + {a_2}\cos 2\Omega_0 t + {a_3}\cos 3\Omega_0 t +  \cdots  + {a_n}\cos n\Omega_0 t +  \cdots  \\ 
   &+& {b_1}\sin \Omega_0 t + {b_2}\sin 2\Omega_0 t + {b_3}\sin 3\Omega_0 t +  \cdots  + {b_n}\sin n\Omega_0 t +  \cdots  \\ 
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

or equivalently (if more confusingly)

$$
f(t) = \frac{1}{2}{a_0} + \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {({a_n}\cos n\Omega_0 t + {b_n}\sin n\Omega_0 t)}
$$

where $\Omega_0$ rad/s is the *fundamental frequency*.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Notation

* The first term $a_o/2$ is a constant and represents the DC (average) component of the signal $f(t)$
* The terms with coefficients $a_1$ and $b_1$ together represent the fundamental frequency component of $f(t)$ at frequency $\Omega_0$.
* The terms with coefficients $a_2$ and $b_2$ together represent the second harmonic frequency component of $f(t)$ at frequency $2\Omega_0$.

And so on.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

Since any periodic function $f(t)$ can be expressed as a Fourier series, it follows that the sum of the DC, fundamental, second harmonic and so on must produce the waveform $f(t)$.

### Sums of sinusoids

In general, the sum of two or more sinusoids does not produce a sinusoid as shown below.

### Evaluation of the Fourier series coefficients

The coefficients are obtained from the following expressions (valid for any periodic waveform with fundamental frequency $\Omega_0$ so long as we integrate over one period $0\to T_0$ where $T_0 = 2\pi/\Omega_0$), and $\theta = \Omega_0 t$:

$$\frac{1}{2}a_0 = \frac{1}{T_0}\int_{0}^{T_0}f(t)d t = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}f(\theta )d \theta$$

$$a_n = \frac{1}{T_0}\int_{0}^{T_0}f(t)\cos n\Omega_0 t\,dt = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}f(\theta)\cos n\theta\,d\theta$$

$$b_n = \frac{1}{T_0}\int_{0}^{T_0}f(t)\sin n\Omega_0 t\,dt = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}f(\theta)\sin n\theta \,d\theta$$

## Odd, Even and Half-wave Symmetry

### Odd and even symmetry

* An *odd* function is one for which $f(t) = -f(-t)$. The function $\sin t$ is an *odd* function.
* An *even* function is one for which $f(t) = f(-t)$. The function $\cos t$ is an *even* function.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

### Half-wave symmetry

* A periodic function with period $T$ is a function for which $f(t) = f(t + T)$
* A periodic function with period $T$, has *half-wave symmetry* if $f(t) = -f(t + T/2)$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

## Symmetry in Trigonometric Fourier Series

There are simplifications we can make if the original periodic properties has certain properties:

* If $f(t)$ is odd, $a_0=0$ and there will be no cosine terms so ${a_n} = 0\; \forall n > 0$
* If $f(t)$ is even, there will be no sine terms and ${b_n} = 0\; \forall n > 0$. The DC may or may not be zero.
* If $f(t)$ has *half-wave symmetry* only the odd harmonics will be present. That is $a_n$ and $b_n$ is zero for all even values of $n$ (0, 2, 4, ...)

### Some simplifications that result from symmetry

* The limits of the integrals used to compute the coefficents $a_n$ and $b_n$ of the Fourier series are given as $0\to 2\pi$ which is one period $T$
* We could also choose to integrate from $-\pi \to \pi$
* If the function is *odd*, or *even* or has *half-wave symmetry* we can compute $a_n$ and $b_n$ by integrating from $0\to \pi$ and multiplying by 2.
* If we have *half-wave symmetry* we can compute $a_n$ and $b_n$ by integrating from $0\to \pi/2$ and multiplying by 4.

* As before $a_0=0$
* We observe that this function is even, so all $b_k$ coefficents will be zero
* The waveform has half-wave symmetry, so only odd indexed coefficents will be present.
* Further more, because it has half-wave symmetry we can just integrate from $0 \to \pi/2$ and multiply the result by 4.

## Gibbs Phenomenon

In an earlier slide we found that the trigonometric for of the Fourier series of the square waveform is

$$f(t) = \frac{4A}{\pi}\left(\sin \Omega_0 t + \frac{1}{3}\sin 3\Omega_0 t + \frac{1}{5}\sin 5\Omega_0 t + \cdots\right) = \frac{4A}{\pi}\sum_{n=\mathrm{odd}}\frac{1}{n}\sin n\Omega_0 t$$

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

This figure shows the approximation for the first 11 harmonics:

<img src="pictures/fsq_trig.png">

As we add more harmonics, the sum looks more and more like a square wave. However the crests do not become flattened; this is known as *Gibbs Phenomenon* and it occurs because of the discontinuity of the perfect sqare waveform as it changes from 
$+A$ to $-A$ and *vice versa*.
