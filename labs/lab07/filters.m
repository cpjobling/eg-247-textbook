%% Basic parameters
% We will be designing a digital filter and plotting frequency spectra
% using a digital technique called the Fast Fourier Transform. So we need
% to define our sampling times, etc.
%
% Note we are doing this in advance of presenting sampling theory!
Ts = 0.001;   % sampling time
fs = 1/Ts;    % sampling frequency in Hz
ws = 2*pi*fs; % sampling frequency in rad/s
%% Signal with noise
% generate the noisy signal which will be filtered
f0 = 12;      % Hz
t = 0:Ts:1.23;
x = cos(2*pi*f0*t);
x(end) = []; % removes last element
%%
% Additive noise is simulated by band-passing a random signal between
% $0.6\omega_s$ and $0.7\omega_s$
[b a] = butter(2,[0.6 0.7],'bandpass');
filtered_noise = filter(b,a,randn(1, length(x)*2));
x = (x + 0.5*filtered_noise(500:500+length(x)-1))/length(x)*2;

%% Frequency spectrum
% Plot magnitude spectrum of the signal.
% In interpreting this plot note that the DFT bin number is
% related to the number of samples in the original
% signal which happens to be 1230 in this case.
%
% Also, the frequency range is normaized to 0-$\omega_s$.
X_mags = abs(fft(x));

% We now plot the first half of DFT (normalised frequency)
% after converting the bin number to its corresponding frequency.
% Note 1 corresponds to half the sampling frequency.

num_bins = length(X_mags);
plot([0:1/(num_bins/2 -1):1], X_mags(1:num_bins/2))
xlabel('Normalised frequency (\pi rads/sample)')

% If we prefer, we can also plot the DFT in Hz.
%
% Note I've plotted a line at f0 as a verification of this result.

%% Butterworth filter
% Design a second order filter using a butterworth design technique.
% The first argument is the order of the filter
% The second argument is the cut-off frequency Wn normalized
% to half the sampling frequency. That is 0 < Wn < 1 where $1 =
% \omega_s/2$.
% The third argument is the type of filter.
%
% See the documentation for more information 'doc butter'.
%%
% In the spectrum we obtained previously, the noise occurs between
% 0.5 and 0.7 on the noramized frequency scale, so we choose 0.3 as Wn.
[b a] = butter(2, 0.3, 'low')

%%
% You should examine the filter response to confirm that the cut-off
% frequency (when magnitude H(jw) = 0.707) is 0.3.
%Redesign the filter using a higher order filter

%the butter filter design function

%% GUI for filter design
% Matlab provides a filter design tool. Use it to design
% and test a low-pass butterworth filter with sampling frequency equal to your
% student number whose cut-off frequency (in Hz) is
% equal to the nearest whole number to your student number divided by 10 and whose stop band
% is the nearest whole number to your student number divided by 5.
% The filter should have 3dB in the pass band and 60 dB in the stop band.
%
% Save the result as lab8.mat and submit this for assessment along with a script lab8.m that demonstrates
% that the filter has the correct pass band, stop band and cut-off frequency behaviour.
