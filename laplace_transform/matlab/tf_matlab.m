%% Defining Transfer Functions in Matlab
%%
% There are two forms of polynomial representation in Matlab. The most obvious is the 
% *expanded polynomial form* where the numerator and denominator of a transfer 
% function would be entered as two row vectors with the polynomial coefficients entered 
% in the order of *descending* powers of $s$.
%
% For example, if:
%
% $$G(s) = \frac{a(s)}{b(s)} = \frac{s^2 +2s+3}{s^3 +4s^2 +5s+6}$$
%
% The numerator and denominator are entered in Matlab as
b = [1, 2, 3];
a = [1, 4, 5, 6];
%%
% Missing coefficients, must be entered as zero: so $q(s) = s^2 +2s$ and 
% $r(s) = s^4 +s^2 + 1$ are entered as
q = [1, 2, 0];
r = [1, 0, 2, 0, 1];
%% Polynomials - Factorised form¶
% 
% $$G(s) = \frac{(s+1)(s+3)}{s(s+2)(s+4)}$$
%
% The advantage of this formulation is that the *zeros* of the numerator and denominator 
% polynomials are obvious by inspection. So it is often used in the preliminary analysis
% of the performance of a dynamic system. The poles of this transfer function are 
% $s = 0,\,-1\,-4$ and the zeros are $s = -1,\,-3$
%
% In Matlab, this form of transfer function is specified by a column vector of the 
% zeros and a column vector of the poles:
% 
z = [-1; -3];
p = [0; -2; -4];
%%
% A third parameter, the overall gain $K$, completes the definition of the so called 
% *pole-zero-gain* form of transfer function. In this case $K = 1$
K = 1;
%
%% The Linear Time Invariant System Object
%
% A few years ago, the Mathworks introduced a new data object for the creation 
% and manipulation of system transfer functions. This object is called the 
% **Linear Time Invariant (LTI) System Object**. It is used to gather the components 
% of a transfer function (or state-space model -- see Week 4) into a single 
% variable which can then easily be combined with other LTI system objects and passed
% to system analysis functions.
%
% To create a LTI system object representing a factored transfer function the 
% following command is issued:
G = zpk(z,p,K)
%%
% The expanded numerator and denominator form of the transfer function is readily 
% obtained by using a â€œdata extractionâ€ function.
[num,den]=tfdata(G,'v')
%%
% LTI system objects can also be created from the expanded form of a transfer function 
% directly:
G2=tf(num,den)
%%
% and the zeros and poles similarly extracted:
[zeros,poles,gain]=zpkdata(G2,'v')
%%
% LTI system objects can also be created from the expanded form of a transfer function 
% directly:
G2=tf(num,den)
%%
% and the zeros and poles similarly extracted:
[zeros,poles,gain]=zpkdata(G2,'v')
%% Setting LTI Properties
% Numerous options are available to document the LTI system objects that you create. 
% For example, suppose the transfer function |G| represents a servomechanism
% with input |'Voltage|' and output |'Angular Position'|
% We can add this information  to the LTI system as follows:
set(G,'InputName','Voltage','OutputName','Angular Position')
%%
% Such documentary information is probably best added when the LTI system object is 
% created, for example as:
G3=zpk(z,p,K,'InputName','Armature Voltage (V)',...
               'OutputName','Load Shaft Position (rad)',...
               'notes','An armature voltage controlled servomechanism')
%%
% Once the LTI object has been documented, the documentation can be extracted using 
% commands like:
get(G3,'notes')
%%
% One can also access the documentation using an â€œobject referenceâ€ notation
in=G3.InputName, out=G3.OutputName
%%
% All the documentation available on an LTI system object may be extracted with a 
% single command:
get(G3)
%%
% There are numerous other documentation features provided for LTI system objects. 
% Please consult the on-line help for full details.
%
%% System Transformations
% Matlab supports the easy transformation of LTI system objects between expanded and 
% factored forms. For example to convert a transfer function from *expanded* form 
% to pole-zero-gain form the following command is used:
G4 = zpk(G2)
%%
% To convert from zero-pole-gain form to expanded form we use the function
% |tf|
G5 = tf(G)
%% 
% Please note that these transformations are merely a convenience that allow you to 
% work with your preferred form of representation. Most of the tools that deal with LTI 
% system objects will work with any form. Furthermore, you can always use the data 
% extraction functions |zpdata| and |tfdata| to extract the zero-pole-gain and 
% numerator-denominator parameters from a LTI system, no matter in which form it was 
% originally defined, without the need for an explicit conversion.
% 
%% Combining LTI System Objects
% A powerful feature of the LTI system object representation is the ease with which 
% LTI objects can be combined. For example, suppose we have two transfer functions
% 
% $$G_1(s) = \frac{s + 1}{s+3}$$
%
% and
%
% $$G_2(s) = \frac{10}{s(s+2)}$$
%
% then the series combination of the two transfer functions 
%
% $$G_s(s) = G_1(s)G_2(s)$$ 
% 
% is obtained using the |*| (multiplication) operator:
G1=tf([1 1],[1 3]);
G2=tf(10,conv([1 0],[1 2])); % conv is polynomial multiplication
Gs=G1*G2 % series connection of two LTI objects
%%
[zeros,poles,K]=zpkdata(Gs,'v')
%
%%
% The parallel connection of two LTI system objects corresponds to addition 
% 
% $$G_p(s) = G_1(s) + G_2(s)$$
%
Gp = G1 + G2
%%
% The feedback connection of two LTI system objects is also supported. The function 
% feedback is used for this. Let
%
% $$G(s) = \frac{2s^2 + 5s + 1}{s^2 + 2s + 3}$$
%
% be the forward transfer function of a closed-loop system and
%
% $$H(s) = \frac{5(s + 2)}{(s+10)}$$
%
% be the feedback network. Then the closed-loop transfer function (assuming negative
% feedback) is
%
% $$G_c(s) = \frac{G(s)}{1 + G(s)H(s)}$$
% 
% In matlab:
G = tf([2 5 1],[1 2 3],'inputname','torque',...
                         'outputname','velocity');
H = zpk(-2,-10,5);
Gc = feedback(G,H) % negative feedback assumed
%
%% The Analysis of LTI System Objects
% 
% Matlab uses the LTI system objects as parameters for the analysis tools such as 
% |impulse|, |step|, |nyquist|, |bode| and |rlocus|. As an example of their use try each
% of following:
%
%% Root locus
rlocus(G*H)
%% open-loop frequency response
bode(G*H) 
%% closed-loop step response
step(Gc) 
%% closed-loop frequency response
bode(Gc) 
%% closed-loop impulse response
impulse(Gc)
%% Nyquist diagram
nyquist(G*H)
%%
% Matlab also provides two interactive graphical tools that work with LTI system 
% objects.
% * |ltiview| is a graphical tool that can be used to analyze systems defined by LTI 
%    objects. It provides easy access to LTI objects and time and frequency response 
%    analysis tools.
% * |rltool| is an interactive tool for designing controllers using the root locus method. 
% 
% Control engineers will find |sisotool| useful.
%
% You are encouraged to experiment with these tools.
%
%% Partial Fraction Expansions
%
% Matlab provides a command called |residue| that returns the partial fraction expansion 
% of a transfer function. That is, given
%
% $$G(s)= \frac{s^m +b_{m-1}s^{m-1} + \cdots + b_1s+b_0}{s^n +a_{n-1}s^{n-1} + \cdots a_1s+a_0}$$
%
% it returns
% 
% $$\frac{r_1}{s + p_1} + \frac{r_2}{s + p_2} + \cdots + \frac{R_n}{s + p_n} + K(s)$$   
%
% where $p_i$ are the poles of the transfer function, $r_i$ are the coefficients of the 
% partial fraction terms (called the *residues of the poles*) and $K(s)$ is a remainder 
% polynomial which is usually empty. 
%
% To use this, the starting point must (rather perversely) be the expanded form of the 
% transfer function in polynomial form. 
%
% Thus given
%
% $$C(s) = \frac{5(s + 2)}{s(s+3)(s+10)}$$
%
% we obtain the partial fraction expansion using the Matlab command sequence:
k = 5; z = [-2]; p = [0; -3; -10]; % zero-pole-gain form
C = zpk(z,p,k);
[num,den] = tfdata(C,'v')
%
% (Note that the leading terms in num are zero).
%%
[r,p,k] = residue(num,den)
%%
% which we interpret to mean
%
% $$C(s) = \frac{0.3333}{s} + \frac{0.2381}{s + 3} - \frac{0.5714}{s + 5}.$$
%
%% 
% If $C(s)$ represents the step response of the system 
%
% $$G(s) = \frac{5(s + 2)}{(s + 3)(s + 10)}$$
%
% then the step response is, by *Inverse Laplace Transform*:
%
% $$y(t) = \left( {0.3333 + 0.2381{e^{ - 3t}} - 0.5714{e^{ - 10t}}}
% \right){u_0}(t).$$
%
% You can check this with the commands:
%
newC = tf([5, 10],[1, 13, 30])
step(newC) % provides $u_0(t)$
%%
t = 0:.05:1.5; % time vector
c = 0.3333 + 0.2381 * exp(-3*t) - 0.5714 * exp(-10*t);
plot(t,c)
