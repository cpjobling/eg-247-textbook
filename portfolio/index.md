# Laboratory Exercises

In the first 6 weeks of the course we will introduce you to the various tools that MATLAB and Simulink provide for designing signal processing systems. This will provide you with sufficient experience to be able to tackle the project.

If you need a MATLAB refresher, you may wish to work through the [MATLAB Tutorial](tutorial/matlab-tutorial) first.

* [Lab 01: Elementary Signals](lab01/index)
* [Lab 02: Laplace and Inverse Laplace Transforms](lab02/index)
* [Lab 03: Laplace Transforms and Transfer Functions for Circuit Analysis](lab03/index)
* [Lab 04: Time Domain Convolution](lab04index)
* [Lab 05: Fourier Series](lab05/index)
* [Lab 06: Audio Signals and Sampling](lab06/index)

There is an additional lab which may help your preperation for the project.

* [Lab 07: Filters](lab07/index)
