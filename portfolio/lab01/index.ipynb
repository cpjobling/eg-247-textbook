    "The lab component will be assessed based on a portfolio of the MATLAB scripts, Simulink models and publishable MATLAB Live Scripts. You should therefore aim to keep all the files from each lab session in a suitable folder in your workspace on the `p:\\` drive. I would suggest a structure like **eg-247-textbook\\portfolio\\lab01** which matches the layout of the files on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cpjobling/eg-247-textbook/tree/master/portfolio).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Explore the properties of the unit step and Dirac delta functions using the analysis and plotting tools  provided by MATLAB in the *Symbolic Math Toolbox*.\n",
    "1. Synthesise a generalised signal in Simulink and plot it and its derivative.\n",
    "1. Experience **Peer Assessment** as a coursework moderation and feedback process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will introduce the symbolic toolbox and the `heaviside`, `delta` and `ezplot` functions provided by MATLAB  and the *signal design block*, *multiplexer*, *scope* and *derivative* blocks provided by Simulink for the simulation of continuous time signals and systems.\n",

    "We will also demonstrate the Live Script feature provided by MATLAB that will be useful for recording lab results for this module."
