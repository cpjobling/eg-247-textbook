## A Note on Simulink Models

Simulink has the unfortunate feature that every new release makes simulink models unusable in 
previous versions of MATLAB. 

The current version is r2021a, released on 17th February 2021.

Luckily, Simulonk will open older versions of Simulink files so I have 
included old versions of the `Three_Band_Eq_Model` in the folder `old-versions`.

If you get an error message, try opening one of these. The 2017a version
should work, but if you have problems, contact me and I'll add to the list.

Note a `.mdl` file is a text-only version of the equivalent  binary `.slx` file.
