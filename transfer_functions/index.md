# Unit 2: Transfer Function Analysis of Dynamic Systems

This unit has been adapted from the MATLAB curriculum module [Transfer Function Analysis of Dynamic Systems](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/94635-transfer-function-analysis-of-dynamic-systems?s_tid=srchtitle) ({cite}`allie24`).

Additional background material is available in Units [3](https://cpjobling.github.io/eg-150-textbook/lti_systems/index.html#) and [4](https://cpjobling.github.io/eg-150-textbook/laplace_transform/index.html) of the lecture notes for [EG-150 Signals and Systems](https://cpjobling.github.io/eg-150-textbook/) ({cite}`jobling-eg-150`)

You can run the original MATLAB LiveScripts by visiting [Transfer Function Analysis of Dynamic Systems](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/94635-transfer-function-analysis-of-dynamic-systems?s_tid=srchtitle) and following the link to **Open in MATLAB Online**.

This will install a project called `Repositories/Transfer-Function-Analysis-of-Dynamic-Systems` on your MATLAB Drive. If you have the *MATLAB Connector* installed (see instructions on [Canvas](https://canvas.swansea.ac.uk/courses/44853/pages/prepare-the-matlab-curriculum-module-used-in-these-labs?module_item_id=2512408)) the project will be automatically synced to your desktop.

Run the project by finding and opening the file `TransferFunctions.prj`.

The notes and the lab that follow are based on this resource and need it to be available.
